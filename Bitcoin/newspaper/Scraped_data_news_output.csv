"China, a Major Bitcoin Source, Considers Moving Against It",['Cao Li'],"HONG KONG — China is planning new steps that could put a stop to making Bitcoin there, a move that could cut off one of the world’s largest sources of the popular but unstable cryptocurrency.

The National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top economic planning body, this week added cryptocurrency mining to a list of about 450 industries that it proposes to eliminate. If the move is approved, local governments in China will be prohibited from supporting makers of Bitcoin and other digital currencies through subsidies or other benefits.

The commission said it would seek public comment until May 7 before making a final decision.

China was once the world’s largest Bitcoin maker, though rising government pressure has forced many of those who make the cryptocurrency, known as miners, to other countries. Still, a number of Bitcoin miners could remain, especially if local governments ignored the instructions and found a way to prop up local producers, people in the business say.

"Amid Bitcoin Uncertainty, ‘the Smart Money Knows That Crypto Is Not Ready’",['Nathaniel Popper'],"SAN FRANCISCO — Paul Chou was among the many Bitcoin aficionados who thought big Wall Street institutions were about to become heavy hitters in the cryptocurrency markets.

Mr. Chou came from one of those institutions, Goldman Sachs, and created a cryptocurrency exchange, LedgerX, that would cater to big investors with sophisticated financial contracts.

Now, in the wake of last year’s Bitcoin crash, Mr. Chou is being forced to confront how few of the big finance companies acted on their cryptocurrency plans.

“It was definitely part of the original plan that institutions would be a big part of this market,” he said. “We were wrong.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/31/business/00bitcoin/00bitcoin-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/technology/cryptocurrency-bust-wall-street.html,2019-04-02 00:00:00
Bitcoin Tycoon Who Oversaw Mt. Gox Implosion Gets Suspended Sentence,['Ben Dooley'],"TOKYO — A Tokyo court handed down a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence on Friday to the former head of Mt. Gox, a cryptocurrency exchange that helped establish Bitcoin as a household name before spectacularly imploding amid allegations of mismanagement.

Still, Mark Karpelès, the French national who presided over Mt. Gox’s rise to become the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, will not serve additional time if he remains on good behavior.

The verdict ended a more-than-five-year ordeal for Mr. Karpelès, who was found guilty on a charge of falsifying data but innocent of two additional charges of embezzlement and breach of trust. He was arrested in August 2015 and held for almost a year in detention, where he spent months under interrogation by prosecutors who upped the pressure by adding more charges against him.

His sentence was suspended for four years, effectively meaning he will serve no additional jail time as long as he remains on good behavior.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/15/world/15bitcoin-1/15bitcoin-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/business/bitcoin-mt-gox-mark-karpeles-sentence.html,2019-03-15 00:00:00
"How a Bitcoin Evangelist Made Himself Vanish, in 15 (Not So Easy) Steps",['Nathaniel Popper'],"In October 2017, a SWAT team descended on Jameson Lopp’s house in North Carolina. Someone — it still isn’t clear who — had called the police and falsely claimed that a shooter at the home had killed someone and taken a hostage. After the police left, Mr. Lopp received a call threatening more mayhem if he did not make a large ransom payment in Bitcoin.

To scare off future attackers, Mr. Lopp quickly posted a video on Twitter of himself firing off his AR-15 rifle. He also decided he was going to make it much harder for his enemies — and anyone else — to find him ever again.

Mr. Lopp, a self-described libertarian who works for a Bitcoin security company, had long been obsessed with the value of privacy, and he set out to learn how thoroughly a person can escape the all-seeing eyes of corporate America and the government. But he wanted to do it without giving up internet access and moving to a shack in the woods.

Many celebrities and wealthy people, wary of thieves, paparazzi and other predators, have tried to achieve Mr. Lopp’s vision of complete privacy.

Facebook and Telegram Are Hoping to Succeed Where Bitcoin Failed,"['Nathaniel Popper', 'Mike Isaac']","Facebook has been coy about what it is building. The team is in an office with separate key-card access so other Facebook employees cannot get in, according to two Facebook employees.

Facebook is looking at several ways to use the blockchain, the technology introduced by Bitcoin that makes it possible to keep shared records of financial transactions on several computers, rather than relying on one big central player like PayPal or Visa.

The five people who have been briefed on the Facebook team’s work said the company’s most immediate product was likely to be a coin that would be pegged to the value of traditional currencies, as Bloomberg first reported.

A digital token with a stable value would not be attractive to speculators — the main audience for cryptocurrencies so far — but it would allow consumers to hold it and pay for things without worrying about the value of the coin rising and falling.

Several other companies have recently introduced so-called stablecoins, linked to the value of the dollar. JPMorgan Chase even said it was experimenting with the concept last month.

Facebook is looking at pegging the value of its coin to a basket of different foreign currencies, rather than just the dollar, three people briefed on the plans said. Facebook could guarantee the value of the coin by backing every coin with a set number of dollars, euros and other national currencies held in Facebook bank accounts.

The company is overhauling its messaging infrastructure, which would connect three of its properties — Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram. That integration, which could take more than a year, would extend the reach of Facebook’s digital currency across the 2.7 billion people who use one of the three apps each month.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/01/business/01socialcoin/28socialcoin-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/technology/cryptocurrency-facebook-telegram.html,2019-02-28 00:00:00
Opinion | Bitcoin Has Saved My Family,['Carlos Hernández'],"Early last year, he started doing graphic design and translations online. But most websites pay for freelance work through PayPal and the like, which we can’t use because exchange controls here allow Venezuelan banks to use only local currency. (For the outside world, even those of us who have bank accounts here are effectively unbanked.) So Juan had to turn to cryptocurrencies to get paid.

Thanks to those earnings, he started thinking about leaving Venezuela. He was able to buy what he needed for the trip to Colombia: clothes, a backpack, a smartphone. He put some money aside. He even gained a little weight, an anomaly around here these days.

Cryptocurrencies also helped him during the four-day trip itself. Venezuelan military personnel at the borders have a reputation for seizing the money of people who want to leave, but Juan’s, being in Bitcoin, was accessible only with a password he had memorized. “Borderless money” is more than a buzzword for those of us who live in a collapsing economy and a collapsing dictatorship.

The plan was for him to send money home — through cryptocurrencies — after he earned enough. Western Union converts remittances into bolívars at the official government rate, which often is about half of the rate on the black market. Some intermediaries do convert at the black market rate, and many of my Venezuelan friends living abroad use those. But if you don’t have a trusted trader, you can easily get scammed. And the government has been trying to shut down go-betweens like those for years. Using Bitcoin is cheaper, faster and safer.

We had it all figured out. But then Juan couldn’t find a decent job in Colombia. After three months he ran out of money, and I had to send him Bitcoins so that he could come back to Venezuela.

And even cryptocurrencies can go only so far.

On Tuesday, after changing my Bitcoins into bolívars — about $5 worth — I went out for milk. I went to every one of the stores within walking distance of my house that hasn’t shut down over the past year. Not one of the 20 had milk.

But I had to buy something, anything, before my bolívars lost value. So I bought cheese, from a store that had only cheese. Well, it also had transparent green plastic bags with no labels and what the seller said was corn flour. But I didn’t dare to buy that.

Is Blockchain Technology Overhyped?,['James Ryerson'],"Blockchain, the ingenious database technology best known for underpinning the faddish digital currency Bitcoin, is reviving the utopian fantasies of the early internet era. In an influential manifesto from that time, “A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace,” published in 1996, the essayist and activist John Perry Barlow opposed the idea of government regulation of the internet, offering instead an anarchical vision of an online world in which a decentralized network of people existed free from all authorities and intermediaries save for their own “social contract.” Whatever else Barlow’s statement might have been, it was not prophetic. The online world today is full of authorities and intermediaries — search engines, social media platforms, cloud computing services, internet service providers — all of which exert considerable control over cyberspace and are themselves shaped by laws and regulations. It is hard to imagine a cyberlibertarian paradise emerging from that.

Or it was hard to imagine, until blockchain came along. The first blockchain was the database introduced in 2009 as the infrastructure of Bitcoin; it is where every transaction involving Bitcoin is stored. Because this database is “distributed” (it is supported only by the network of its many thousands of users, with no central or controlling nodes) and because, thanks to a cunning design, it can essentially guarantee the integrity and authenticity of the information it stores, it demonstrates that a functioning currency does not require a bank or equivalent centralized institution. Whether Bitcoin itself ends up being successful is not what matters. What matters is the discovery that the underlying blockchain technology can obviate the need for centralized authorities in contexts where they were once thought to be indispensable. This includes social, political, economic and legal transactions involving not just currency but also stock certificates, deeds to plots of land, titles to copyrighted works, remittance payments, food supply chains, votes in an electoral system and so on.

For the John Perry Barlows of today, blockchain represents a new opportunity to free people from governments, corporations and other sources of centralized control. (Indeed, a few true believers, made rich during the recent digital currency boom, are spending millions of dollars on potential experimental communities where rights and contracts would be implemented using blockchain technology.) But for the legal scholars Primavera De Filippi and Aaron Wright, the innovative promise of blockchain, though real, has been exaggerated. As they argue in BLOCKCHAIN AND THE LAW: The Rule of Code (Harvard University, $35), the growth and evolution of this technology “will follow a similar path” to that of the internet itself: from anarchic potential to a more regulated and controlled reality. They also argue that this is desirable — that blockchain visionaries looking to free people from the hegemony of governments and corporations “could wind up surrendering themselves (and others) to the whims of a much more powerful enemy”: namely, the self-governing code of blockchain itself.

To understand why many proponents of blockchain assume, contrary to De Filippi and Wright, that the technology can and should remain impervious to external control, it helps to understand some details about how such a technology works. Imagine you want to send someone a certain amount of Bitcoin as payment for a service provided. Rather than having the payment go through a bank to be authorized, as it would if you paid with a check or credit card, the proposed transaction is shared with and authorized by the entire Bitcoin network. To determine whether you have enough Bitcoin to make your payment, the computers on the network search through the history of all previous Bitcoin transactions. If your transaction is valid, it is added to a list, or “block,” of recent pending transactions. Every 10 minutes or so, the latest block is collectively verified by the network and added to the “chain” of all the previous blocks. Everyone’s Bitcoin account balance is updated accordingly. This communally maintained history of total transactions — a copy of which is shared with every node of the network — is the blockchain.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/books/review/17IvoryTower/17IvoryTower-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/books/review/blockchain.html,2019-02-15 00:00:00
JPMorgan Chase Moves to Be First Big U.S. Bank With Its Own Cryptocurrency,"['Michael J. De La Merced', 'Nathaniel Popper']","JPMorgan’s version will be less useful than other similar products because it will not be possible to move it outside the firm’s own systems, at least initially. What’s more, it is still just being tested and is not available to clients yet.

But the entry of a major Wall Street bank into the market shows the mundane ways in which cryptocurrency technology has begun to gain traction in the traditional financial system a year after the prices of Bitcoin and other digital tokens crashed in spectacular fashion.

The firm said it began working last year on what became JPM Coin to help its big customers, including major corporations and other banks, move money quickly and securely. (JPMorgan says it provides banking services for about 80 percent of Fortune 500 companies.)

Essentially, when customers want to move dollars using the bank’s blockchain system, money in their JPMorgan accounts will be converted into JPM Coins, each one backed by a dollar in JPMorgan’s accounts.

The token will be able to move nearly instantaneously on the coin’s ledger, which will initially be based on JPMorgan’s Quorum blockchain. Once transfers are competed, the coins can be converted back to dollars.

The advantage of such a token, Mr. Farooq said, is speed. Clients that want to move huge sums of money would traditionally need to do so via wire transfer, a process that could take hours or even days. With international transfers, changes in currency exchange rates during the long lag times could end up adding to customers’ costs.

Mr. Farooq said JPMorgan’s offering would be useful for big clients, but not for the smaller speculators who have typically taken an interest in cryptocurrencies.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/15/business/15DB-CHASECRYPTO-print/15DB-CHASECRYPTO-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/business/dealbook/jpmorgan-cryptocurrency-bitcoin.html,2019-02-14 00:00:00
Cryptocurrency Was Their Way Out of South Korea’s Lowest Rungs. They’re Still Trying.,"['Alexandra Stevenson', 'Su-Hyun Lee']","Cryptocurrencies seemed to be a way to disrupt that social order.

“There is no true opportunity in South Korea for the average young person,” said Kim Han-gyeol, 23, who graduated from a vocational school and became a part-time software developer for an e-book company.

She lives with her parents and works part time at Dunkin’ Donuts, studying English online at night.

At first, she made a lot of money investing in cryptocurrencies. She used a few thousand dollars she made to buy nice clothes for herself and her mother, and dreamed of starting a coffee shop with her loot. Then, she lost nearly all of it.

“I felt a sense of shame when I lost money on my Bitcoin investments, not once but twice because of my greed to make a fortune in one go,” she said. Even still, she added, she’ll stick to digital coins.

“There is nowhere else to go to recover my losses anyway,” she said.

Being young in South Korea can be defeating and stifling. To succeed is to get either a government position or a job at one of a small but powerful group of family-owned conglomerates that control most of the products Koreans use. This requires getting into one of a handful of exclusive universities, a feat that has become so difficult that many young people delay applying for several years.

Income inequality is among the worst in Asia. Youth unemployment is 10.5 percent and has hovered near that figure for the past five years even as overall unemployment is 3.4 percent.

"Behind Tech’s Shine, Some Warnings Signs Appear","['David Streitfeld', 'Don Clark']","SAN FRANCISCO — Don’t look now: Storm clouds are gathering over tech.

Chinese consumers have pulled back their spending, blowing a $9 billion hole in Apple’s recent quarterly revenue. China was again a culprit when Nvidia warned last month that its revenue would come in 20 percent below expectations, though the graphics chip maker also blamed slack demand from Bitcoin miners and cloud data centers.

Intel, the big chip maker, cited intensifying “trade and macro concerns” for financial results in January that did not meet expectations. And Samsung, another semiconductor powerhouse, said sales plunged 10 percent in the fourth quarter because of weakening demand for its memory chips from data centers and smartphones.

China, smartphones, Bitcoin and cloud computing have been among the major drivers of the long tech boom, which in turn has powered the global economy for the last decade. The ingredient common to all of these sectors is computer chips, which form the brains of devices and whose ubiquity means they provide early signals about changes in supply and demand.

How Bitcoin Could Help Iran Undermine U.S. Sanctions,['Thomas Erdbrink'],"Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a digital ledger or database known as the blockchain, maintained communally by many independent computers. The system is designed explicitly to avoid central banks and large financial institutions. Like emails delivered without going through a central postal service, the computer network maintaining Bitcoin records enables the movement of money without going through any central authority.

The Iranian government has been slow to recognize the potential sanctions-evading possibilities of Bitcoin. But it is now considering the establishment of exchanges to facilitate trading, one official, Abdolhassan Firouzabadi, said recently. Despite the failure of Venezuela’s state-backed cryptocurrency, the Petro, Iran’s central bank said recently that it was seriously considering creation of something similar, possibly called the Crypto-Rial, named after the national currency, the rial.

Still, Iran’s venture into Bitcoin pales in comparison to what has been happening the former Soviet republic of Georgia, where thousands of people have jumped into the cryptocurrency business.

At the computerized processing operation in the Iranian desert, no one seemed particularly concerned with the geopolitical implications of Bitcoin.

The operation consisted of 2,800 computers from China, fitted into eight containers, which when linked are called a farm. It makes intense mathematical calculations, known as mining, needed to confirm Bitcoin transactions. Miners collect fees in Bitcoin for their services.

Ignoring the rain, the European visitor used the calculator on his mobile phone to determine how much money could be made from this particular farm, multiplying computer power and deducting electricity and operational costs.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/30/world/30IRAN-BITCOIN-print/00IRAN-BITCOIN05-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/world/middleeast/bitcoin-iran-sanctions.html,2019-01-29 00:00:00
"Despite Bitcoin’s Dive, a Former Soviet Republic Is Still Betting Big on It",['Liz Alderman'],"Industry estimates suggest the company mines just over 5 percent of all Bitcoins, although no one would say how much was being mined here.

But competitors in Georgia reckon it was a fortune. Vakhtang Gogokhia, the chief executive of Golden Fleece, a small cryptomining start-up, said he was pulling in around 10 Bitcoins a month using one megawatt of energy, enough to light 1,000 homes. Bitfury says it constantly consumes at least 45 megawatts of energy, though Mr. Gogokhia suspected it was more.

Critics say the government, by subsidizing operations like Bitfury, is ripping off taxpayers by forcing them to foot the bill for well-connected companies.

Zurab Tchiaberashvili, a lawmaker from European Georgia, the largest opposition party in Parliament, said the government’s generosity toward Bitfury had deprived Georgians of millions in tax revenue.

“It’s a huge conflict of interest,” he said.

Mr. Urumashvili brushed off such concerns. “Bitfury has given our country many things, including a path to the future,” he said. “When you have a ticket to get onto the world map,” he added, “you should use it.”

Still, as Bitcoin prices highlight the uncertain nature of cryptocurrencies, the government isn’t putting all of its eggs in one basket.

“Georgia is interesting for cryptocurrency miners,” said Mr. Kobulia, the economy minister. “But would it be a major source of our economic growth? Maybe not.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/23/business/23georgiacrypto-print1/00georgiacrypto-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/business/georgia-bitcoin-blockchain-bitfury.html,2019-01-22 00:00:00
"From Goldman’s 1MDB Scandal to Bitcoin, Here’s a Look Ahead at 2019",['Peter J. Henning'],"Although Goldman has pledged its cooperation, the firm has also claimed that it is innocent of the Malaysian charges and may well be girding for a fight with the Justice Department to limit its liability. Goldman also will have to deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which shares jurisdiction over the bribery law, and the Federal Reserve, Goldman’s chief banking regulator.

Goldman has little choice but to reach a settlement. The key question is how much its entanglement with 1MDB may cost the firm. Disgorging the $600 million fee it earned for arranging the bond deals is the likely starting point for any resolution in the United States.

How much a potential fine could be on top of that is anyone’s guess. One possibility is that it will be a multiple of Goldman’s profit on the transaction. That could push the penalty over a billion dollars, with the possibility of even more if Goldman has to reach an agreement with the Malaysian government.

Do Cryptocurrencies Need a New Regulator?

The precipitous fall in the value of cryptocurrencies in 2016 cries out for greater regulation to protect investors. Studies have shown that the market for cryptocurrencies is subject to widespread manipulation, which puts smaller investors at the mercy of those who are trying to profit from the price swings.

Two bills were introduced in Congress in December to address manipulation in the cryptocurrency markets. Neither offers a concrete step toward regulating trading platforms, nor do they designate oversight to a single agency.

As investors have suffered losses, the questions have increased about whether cryptocurrencies will survive as a viable investment class. Without greater government oversight to curb manipulation, the interest of small investors may well dry up.

Remember Bitcoin? Some Investors Might Want to Forget,['Nellie Bowles'],"PALO ALTO, Calif. — Last year around this time, a toy called a cryptokitty sold for $170,000.

Can Cryptocurrencies Survive the Start of Government Regulation?,['Peter J. Henning'],"I.C.O. manipulation

On the same day the S.E.C. issued its statement last month, it also settled two cases with issuers of digital tokens for violating the securities laws, requiring them to pay penalties of $250,000 each and work to refund money to investors in their illegal offerings.

In another case, Maksim Zaslavskiy, who was charged with criminal securities fraud involving an I.C.O., pleaded guilty in a Federal District Court in Brooklyn. This was the first case in which a judge found that the digital coins were a type of security, and therefore subject to the associated antifraud rules.

The S.E.C. settled a case against Zachary Coburn, the founder of a company called EtherDelta that facilitated trading in digital coins, because it operated as an unregistered national securities exchange. For those looking to offer a trading platform in the United States, registering with the S.E.C. as an exchange is also an expensive and time-consuming process.

By the end of the month, the S.E.C. had also settled charges with the boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. and the music producer Khaled Khaled, known as DJ Khaled, for their promotion of digital tokens issued by a start-up called Centra Tech. The men did not disclose that they received payments for making online postings that hyped the digital coin, the regulators said. Mr. Mayweather agreed to give back the $300,000 he received, pay an additional $300,000 penalty and adhere to a three-year ban on promoting other investments. Mr. Khaled will pay back the $50,000 he got, as well as a $100,000 penalty.

The crypto slowdown

But even before the government began its crackdown, there was a big sign that euphoria was evaporating from the market: the decline in cryptocurrency “mining” that generates additional digital tokens. Giga Watt, a digital currency mining operation in Washington state, filed for bankruptcy recently due in large part to the collapse in Bitcoin’s price. Nvidia, which makes graphics chips that are important for mining cryptocurrencies, forecast a 20 percent drop in revenue in its next quarter because of “the sharp falloff in cryptocurrency mining demand.”

For the naysayers of cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings, this is the anticipated end of a speculative bubble, much like the tulip mania in 17th-century Holland or the dot.com implosion. That does not necessarily mean that this type of investment will disappear, but greater government scrutiny will raise the costs for trading platforms and could effectively eliminate initial coin offerings if they must be registered with the S.E.C.

Blockchain, the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies, is useful, and unlikely to disappear. But whether cryptocurrencies survive as a viable means of conducting business is a different question. Nathaniel Popper pointed out recently in The New York Times that Bitcoin and its brethren were designed to make payments easier but have been “hobbled by technical problems that make their tokens hard to use in real-world transactions. Those working on the cryptocurrencies have promised solutions, but they have been slow to produce them.”

Just like penny stocks, digital tokens have seen their fair share of scam artists and questionable uses. As the government puts more resources into policing the trading of digital assets, the decline in cryptocurrency prices may well accelerate as those who fear being a target of fraudulent conduct wait for a time when there are greater protections for investors. The question is: Will cryptocurriences survive for long enough for us to ever see that day?",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/14/business/14db-henning/14db-henning-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/business/dealbook/sec-ico-bitcoin.html,2018-12-13 00:00:00
Who’s Living in a ‘Bubble’?,['Sasha Chapin'],"It’s obvious that Americans live in social bubbles — living and talking in circles divided by economics, race, ideology, geography, taste and so on. The problem arises as soon as you try to differentiate those that constitute real “bubbles” — which is to say, self-reinforcing spheres of blindness or irrationality — from those that might just as easily be called “cultures” or “communities,” groups of people who share experiences and convictions. Such groupings will certainly have drawbacks; our shared preconceptions often limit us. But to use the word “bubble” as a stand-alone pejorative is to focus on the ignorance inherent in a given worldview, rather than the insights; it’s to examine ideological opponents and conclude that the only reason they could possibly believe what they do is because they haven’t examined alternatives.

It’s nice to imagine that we can broaden someone’s understanding of the world by illuminating their blind spots. The problem is that our helpful corrections are likely to be totally wrong. A well-meaning diagnosis of conservative bubbles like LeTourneau’s — “when everyone you know is a Republican,” she writes, “you can’t imagine anyone who isn’t” — might run up against complicated research results: say, one that indicates conservatives are actually better at modeling liberal beliefs than the other way around.

The difficulty of getting it right might explain the overwhelming vindication people clearly feel when someone else’s ideological bubble really has been pricked. Less than two days after President Trump’s electoral victory, The New York Post published a column by Michael Goodwin that was positively triumphant about it: “The cluelessness in media and political circles about the Trump voter surge,” he wrote, “confirms that the ruling class is cosseted deeply in its bubbles and isolated from the concerns of other Americans.” So long as we’re not among a bubble’s inhabitants, its popping flatters our own delusion: that we’re among the few right-thinking people who accurately measure value, who accurately perceive reality, who see far more clearly than the sheeplike, tulip-loving half-wits around us.

What might be more helpful, when talk of a “bubble” crops up, is to think of yourself, rather than others — to be vigilant about the possibility that the most meaningful bubbles are the ones you’re not aware of, rather than the ones you’re eager to spot. They are, after all, incredibly pleasant and convincing when you’re on the inside. The value they create is not an illusion: There is much to be gained from being in mental harmony with those around you, let alone owning something people are paying absurd prices for. It’s dispiriting, perhaps, to think our various blinkers might not be easy to identify, but knowing this offers a sort of peace — the peace of spending less time wondering why everyone else is so hopelessly blinkered. If you’re skeptical of your own ability to see everything clearly, you’ll be less surprised when the actions of others refuse to blow up in their faces — or, perhaps, when you hear your own world emit an unexpected pop.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/16/magazine/16mag-FirstWords-1/16mag-FirstWords-1-facebookJumbo-v2.png,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/magazine/whos-living-in-a-bubble.html,2018-12-11 00:00:00
"Iranians Accused in Cyberattacks, Including One That Hobbled Atlanta","['Nicole Perlroth', 'Katie Benner']","Two Iranians were behind the ransomware attack that crippled Atlanta’s government for days this year, the Justice Department said in an indictment unsealed on Wednesday, detailing a sophisticated scheme of attacks on hospitals, government agencies and other organizations.

The men, Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, chose targets with complex yet vulnerable systems — organizations that could afford to pay ransoms and needed to urgently restore their systems back online, prosecutors said.

In the case of Atlanta, one of the most sustained and consequential cyberattacks ever launched against a major American city, the pair broke into the city’s computer systems and held their data hostage for about $51,000 worth of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, prosecutors said.

“They deliberately engaged in an extreme form of 21st-century digital blackmail, attacking and extorting vulnerable victims like hospitals and schools, victims they knew would be willing and able to pay,” Brian Benczkowski, the head of the criminal division of the Justice Department, said in a news conference on Wednesday.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/29/us/politics/29dc-ransomware/29dc-ransomware-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/us/politics/atlanta-cyberattack-iran.html,2018-11-28 00:00:00
5 Reasons Cryptocurrency Prices Are Plunging Again,['Nathaniel Popper'],"Relying on unregulated infrastructure and exchanges is risky.

Most cryptocurrency trading happens outside the United States on exchanges with little or no regulatory oversight. That allowed investors to pile in with abandon, but the inherent dangers have long been clear.

This year, researchers at the University of Texas published evidence suggesting that one of the largest exchanges, Bitfinex, had helped create a proprietary cryptocurrency, Tether, that was used to artificially pump up the price of Bitcoin and other digital tokens.

Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the Justice Department was conducting a criminal investigation of price manipulation using Tether, one of many issues related to Tether that are scaring investors away. Every unit of Tether is supposed to be backed by a dollar in a bank, but managers of Bitfinex and Tether have struggled to show that they even have bank accounts. Many traders have been selling Tether at a loss just so they can take their money out.

The activities of another large exchange, OKEx, have also led traders to question whether they can trust the institutions at the center of the cryptocurrency industry.

OKEx, which began in China, altered some trading rules without advance notice, according to a large hedge fund, Amber AI, which published a post on Medium about the changes. AmberAI said customers appeared to have lost millions of dollars because of the changes. OKEx, without acknowledging the losses, apologized to customers for some of the changes, which it said had been made to cope with chaotic trading.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/22/business/22cryptomarkets1/merlin_145650132_d5144dce-e9bb-43d0-aae0-685a1d3e7961-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/technology/cryptocurrency-price-drop.html,2018-11-21 00:00:00
Bitcoin’s ‘First Felon’ Faces More Legal Trouble,['Nathaniel Popper'],"The twins asked Mr. Shrem to help them amass the beginnings of what would become an enormous stockpile of cryptocurrencies, giving him $750,000 to buy Bitcoin from other deep-pocketed investors.

A few months into this partnership, the twins said, they realized that Mr. Shrem had not given them all the Bitcoin they were due. The brothers gave Mr. Shrem $250,000 in September 2012, but the lawsuit says that a month later, he delivered only around $189,000 worth of Bitcoin at the going price, which was around $12.50.

The 5,000 or so missing Bitcoins became a point of tension between the twins and Mr. Shrem. They asked him numerous times for an accounting of the Bitcoins he had purchased and eventually brought in an accountant who documented the missing funds, according to court documents.

“I have been patient, and at this point it’s getting a bit absurd,” Cameron Winklevoss wrote to Mr. Shrem in 2013 in an email quoted in the lawsuit. “I don’t take this lightly.”

The missing Bitcoins, which were worth 98 percent less at the time, appeared to have been forgotten in a broader battle between the brothers and Mr. Shrem over an investment in Bitinstant.

In 2013, Bitinstant fell apart, and the twins blocked Mr. Shrem’s efforts to revive the company with new investors because of their concerns about his management style. By the time Mr. Shrem was arrested in 2014, as a result of activities at Bitinstant that took place before the brothers invested, they had cut off contact with him.

The Winklevoss twins’ problems with Mr. Shrem have not held them back. They were briefly each cryptocurrency billionaires last year, and they have built one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, Gemini. Despite this year’s big drop in cryptocurrency prices, their holdings are still worth nearly a billion dollars.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/03/business/03BITCOIN01/00BITCOIN01-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/technology/bitcoin-charlie-shrem-winklevoss-twins.html,2018-11-02 00:00:00
A Cryptocurrency Millionaire Wants to Build a Utopia in Nevada,['Nathaniel Popper'],"STOREY COUNTY, Nev. — An enormous plot of land in the Nevada desert — bigger than nearby Reno — has been the subject of local intrigue since a company with no history, Blockchains L.L.C., bought it for $170 million in cash this year.

The man who owns the company, a lawyer and cryptocurrency millionaire named Jeffrey Berns, put on a helmet and climbed into a Polaris off-road vehicle last week to give a tour of the sprawling property and dispel a bit of the mystery.

He imagines a sort of experimental community spread over about a hundred square miles, where houses, schools, commercial districts and production studios will be built. The centerpiece of this giant project will be the blockchain, a new kind of database that was introduced by Bitcoin.

Netanyahu Won. The Two-State Solution Lost.,[],"Benjamin Netanyahu is poised to form Israel’s next government. With President Trump on his side, a peace deal with the Palestinians seems more elusive than ever.

michael barbaro From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: Donald Trump has promised to broker the deal of the century between Israelis and Palestinians. His partnership with Benjamin Netanyahu has made such a peace deal all but impossible. It’s Thursday, April 11.

archived recording All right, breaking news, critical elections in Israel.

mark landler So on Tuesday morning, Israeli voters woke up and went to the polls in what was by all accounts one of the closest Israeli elections in years.

archived recording Current prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scandal-plagued and facing indictment on fraud and corruption charges, faced centrist candidate General Benny Gantz.

mark landler It pitted the veteran, longtime prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu against an opponent, Benny Gantz, who was actually far more competitive than anyone Netanyahu has faced for some time.

michael barbaro Mark Landler covers the White House for The Times. And indeed, as the voting played out —

archived recording 1 Israel held one of its most consequential elections in decades, and as of right now, it’s not quite clear who’s the winner. archived recording 2 It’s a very close race. It’s a very dramatic election. archived recording 3 This has shaped up, really, to be, frankly, the fight of Mr. Netanyahu’s political life.

mark landler — over the course of the day, and the first exit polls came out, it looked like it was a virtual dead heat.

archived recording (benjamin netanyahu) [SPEAKING HEBREW] archived recording (interpreter) This is a night of a tremendous victory.

mark landler You had both Gantz and Netanyahu claiming victory —

archived recording (benny gantz) [SPEAKING HEBREW] archived recording (interpreter) In elections, there are losers. In elections, there are winners, and we are the winners.

mark landler — in separate rallies on Tuesday evening.

archived recording Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has apparently won an historic fifth term after a tight election race.

mark landler But as the counting inched forward later on Tuesday evening, it became clear that Netanyahu had gotten just enough votes that he was probably going to be able to put together a right-wing coalition and continue in government, a feat that is, by all accounts, remarkable. It would make him, in just a few months, the longest-serving Israeli prime minister since Ben-Gurion and really a commanding figure on the Israeli political stage.

archived recording [HEBREW CHANTING]

mark landler But for all the drama and all the theatrics and all the history that was made in Israel this week, in one important respect, the election actually doesn’t change much. The two-state solution, the solution to end the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, this holy grail of diplomacy that the United States has been working toward for the last four decades is, for all intents and purposes, dead.

archived recording On the 29th of November, 1947, the United Nations voted to establish two states, one Jewish, one Arab, in a partitioned Palestine.

mark landler The dilemma that has faced Israel since its founding in the 1940s was that the land that the Israelis occupied, the ancestral homeland for the Jewish people, was land that was actually also claimed by the Palestinians.

archived recording Directly after the United Nations decision to partition Palestine, the euphoric dream of Jewish statehood in the land of Israel was punctured by the harsh reality of gunfire.

mark landler So what peacemakers have tried to do is figure out if there’s a way to create a separate homeland, a separate state for the Palestinians, one where they would manage their own affairs, enjoy the benefits of self-rule, but live in peace with their neighbors, the Israelis.

archived recording For the third time since its birth as an independent state, Israel is embroiled in a war with the Arab nations that surround it.

mark landler This task became more and more difficult over the years —

archived recording The Israeli spearheads race to the Gaza Strip, advance across the entire Sinai.

mark landler — because through wars and other conquests, the Israelis began to occupy more and more of the land that would form the basis for a Palestinian state.

archived recording A six-day Middle East war echoes along a second front: a diplomatic struggle at the United Nations Security Council.

mark landler And so the really difficult task the peacemakers have had is seeing what kind of formula they could strike that would give the Palestinians enough territory to have a viable state but leave the Israeli state feeling it had adequate security for its own people. And this is what peacemakers, Israelis and American, refer to as the two-state solution.

michael barbaro And how has the U.S. viewed that plan, the two-state solution, historically?

archived recording (bill clinton) Finally, the time is approaching when there will be safety in Israel’s house, when the Palestinian people will write their own destiny, when the clash of arms will be banished from God’s Holy Land.

mark landler Well, the United States has, since early in the Clinton administration, formally set as a policy objective the creation of a Palestinian state, a two-state solution to the conflict.

archived recording (richard nixon) I would say that a profound and, I believe, lasting change has taken place.

mark landler But even before then, going all the way back to the Nixon years, the general push of American policy has been to try to find a solution that would give the Palestinians some kind of homeland.

archived recording (richard nixon) Where there was no hope for peace, there is now hope.

michael barbaro And Mark, just so I understand, why does the U.S. feel strongly about a two-state solution, and why does it care about it?

mark landler I think for a couple of reasons. One is a legal reason. Israel took the land in the West Bank by force in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. This move was condemned widely by the United Nations, by other countries, and even by the United States as an unlawful seizure or conquest of territory. So resolving the status of the West Bank is important from an international law perspective. But beyond that, there is a more important recognition here, which is until and unless we can offer the Palestinian people some sense of homeland, they’re always going to be displaced, unhappy, and they pose a threat not only to Israel, their occupying force, but to other countries in the region. So there’s a sense to which the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is kind of this low-grade powder keg that could explode at any time and bring the rest of the region around it into conflict.

michael barbaro And how does Israel respond to this decades-long push from the U.S. and the rest of the world for a two-state solution?

mark landler Well, it depends very much on who’s in government, but the general trend line in Israel is that early in this process, many Israelis felt that the two-state solution was the only solution to their problem. There was a great deal of sympathy and support in Israel for a two-state solution, not just on the Israeli left, but on the right. But then Benjamin Netanyahu is elected prime minister, and Netanyahu sets in motion a series of programs and policies that have the effect of hardening Israeli attitudes against the desirability of a two-state solution. He really builds up the Israeli economy. He makes Israel a powerhouse in the region. He builds up Israel’s military. He makes Israelis feel, for the first time, more secure. He builds a wall between Israel and the West Bank. So he literally walls off Israelis from the problem of the Palestinians. And by making it easier to turn away from the Palestinians, he contributes to and accelerates this hardening of attitudes in Israel that makes Israelis not just on the right, but, to some extent, on the left, as well, view the two-state solution as a less urgent priority — as something that’s less necessary, less desirable.

michael barbaro And how did the U.S. respond to Netanyahu and to this hardening against the two-state solution that he represented?

mark landler Well, the United States, under Republican and Democratic presidents, has been adamant in their support of a two-state solution. So from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Barack Obama, you had a series of presidents who always pushed against what they viewed as Israeli efforts to undermine a two-state solution — for example, the building of Jewish settlements on the West Bank. Every time the Israelis announced they were building a new settlement, you could count on the White House to issue a statement condemning it.

michael barbaro Because it violated the notion that the Palestinians would have a full state of their own someday?

mark landler Indeed, because merely by putting a Jewish community into what would someday be Palestinian territory, you are undermining the viability of a future state. And so this was a very consistent policy. It was really nonpartisan. Republicans and Democrats supported it. It was an article of faith in the American foreign policy community and a feature of our diplomacy up until Donald Trump became president.

michael barbaro And what did President Trump do differently than his predecessors?

archived recording In your vision for the new Middle East peace, are you ready to give up on the notion of a two-state solution?

mark landler Well, for one thing, the first time President Trump is asked publicly what solution he prefers to resolve the conflict, he says —

archived recording (donald trump) So I’m looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like. I’m very happy with the one that both —

mark landler I’m in favor of a two-state solution, a one-state solution, whatever the two sides want. Later on, he then comes around, months later, and says —

archived recording — say something — [INTERPOSING VOICES] archived recording (donald trump) I like two-state solution.

mark landler I do like a two-state solution.

archived recording (donald trump) That’s what I think works best. I don’t even have to speak to anybody, but that’s my feeling.

mark landler But his commitment to it is always far looser, far flimsier, than any of his predecessors.

archived recording (donald trump) We want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.

mark landler So Donald Trump’s words are sort of all over the place, but his actions are far clearer. What he does, in effect, is he backs up Netanyahu to the hilt. All the actions that Netanyahu wants to do, which would have drawn objections from Trump’s predecessors — he basically gives Netanyahu a blank check. And he himself authorizes several important changes in policy that have the effect of accelerating the undermining of a future Palestinian state.

michael barbaro And what are those changes?

mark landler Well, Trump started off —

archived recording (donald trump) Thank you.

mark landler — by delivering on a campaign promise —

archived recording (donald trump) Therefore, I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

mark landler — to move the United States Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And the reason this was really significant is that the status of Jerusalem is itself contested. Palestinians aspire to having East Jerusalem be the capital of their future state. The administration moves the embassy to Jerusalem, and they don’t, in moving it, make the point that they still view East Jerusalem as a potential Palestinian capital.

archived recording (donald trump) Israel is a sovereign nation with the right, like every other sovereign nation, to determine its own capital.

mark landler They merely declare that the time has come to recognize reality, which is that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.

archived recording (donald trump) God bless you. God bless Israel. God bless the Palestinians. And God bless the United States. Thank you very much.

michael barbaro And in so doing, seem to say it’s not the capital of the future Palestinian state.

mark landler It would seem to foreclose the possibility of having East Jerusalem be the Palestinian capital.

michael barbaro O.K.

archived recording (donald trump) Did you ever talk about the vast amounts of funds, money, that we give to the Palestinians? We give hundreds of millions of dollars.

mark landler The next thing that President Trump does is —

archived recording (donald trump) That money is on the table. That money is not going to them unless they sit down and negotiate peace.

mark landler He cuts aid to the Palestinian Authority, to the United Nations agency that helps Palestinian refugees.

archived recording Today, the Department of State will announce the closure of the Palestine Liberation Organization office here in Washington, D.C.

mark landler And he also closes the Palestinian Authority’s representative office in Washington. The reason these moves are significant is because it has the effect of alienating the Palestinian power structure from the U.S. government and also undermining the credibility of the Palestinian leadership. Remember, any deal has to be negotiated between the Israelis and the Palestinian leadership. But by depriving the Palestinians of these resources, the Trump administration is, in essence, sending a signal that these people are not worth talking to. And that, in turn, has contributed to a rift that has opened up between the Palestinians and the United States over the moving of the embassy.

archived recording (donald trump) In a moment, I will sign a presidential proclamation recognizing Israel’s sovereign right over the Golan Heights.

mark landler Finally, and perhaps most importantly, President Trump recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights.

archived recording (donald trump) The state of Israel took control of the Golan Heights in 1967 to safeguard its security from external threats.

mark landler Like the West Bank and Gaza, the Golan Heights is a slice of territory that Israel seized during war and remains disputed until this day. In recognizing Israel’s claim over the Golan Heights, the Trump administration is, in a way, giving the Israelis a legal pretext to annex other territory that remains disputed.

archived recording (benjamin netanyahu) Look at this. It’s amazing. This is what I did in one week, by the way. I went to Washington and received this declaration by President Trump recognizing Israel’s sovereignty in the Golan Heights. Look at this. Look at what we just got.

mark landler It all amounts to a green light for Prime Minister Netanyahu to make a move on the West Bank. And indeed, a few days later, on the eve of the Israeli election, he did just that.

archived recording This was a big, last-minute promise from Benjamin Netanyahu in a close race. archived recording (benjamin netanyahu) [SPEAKING HEBREW] archived recording He says if he’s re-elected, he’ll annex parts of the West Bank seized by Israel half a century ago and home to nearly half a million settlers, a pledge —

mark landler He told the Israeli press that if he was elected, he would begin to annex large Jewish settlements on the West Bank.

michael barbaro Which is to say he would take as Israelis parts of the West Bank that would be part of this two-state solution.

mark landler That is exactly right.

archived recording So let me ask you this.

michael barbaro And what did the U.S. do?

archived recording Is it still the policy of the United States to oppose Israel’s unilateral annexation of any or all of the West Bank?

mark landler Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked what was the American response.

archived recording (mike pompeo) Here’s what I can say. I’ll give the same answer I gave the senator. We are in the process of laying down our vision for how to resolve a problem that is — archived recording So Mr. Secretary, if I could ask you, I asked about unilateral acts, right, annexation. So that —

mark landler And the U.S. response was conspicuous silence.

archived recording It sounds like you’ve already abandoned what has been a bipartisan foreign policy of opposing the annexation of any or part of the West Bank by Israel. Is that what you’re telling us today? archived recording (mike pompeo) I think we’ve seen — I think it was Senator Durbin that critiqued our decision on the Golan, where you would characterize that. archived recording I’m not asking you about the Golan. archived recording (mike pompeo) Yeah. archived recording I’m asking you about the West Bank. archived recording (mike pompeo) Yeah, and I’m telling you, you will see our proposal — archived recording The polls are closing —

michael barbaro It basically gives Netanyahu permission if he wants to annex these settlements in the West Bank.

mark landler There was no evidence that there would be any American pushback to that.

michael barbaro And is it safe to assume that if the United States and its president didn’t want Israel to take these steps and said, don’t take these steps, that Israel might not do them?

mark landler The answer to that is yes, and the proof of that is if you go back just one president to the Obama administration, you will find plenty of cases where Barack Obama pushed back on steps that the Netanyahu government was taking, particularly in the area of settlement construction, and actually pressured the prime minister to slow down or, in some cases, even halt that construction in order not to alienate their American friends.

michael barbaro And so given that, Mark, why is President Trump doing this? Why would he support Netanyahu in this way?

mark landler So part of it has to do with a genuine kinship between Trump and Netanyahu. They’re very similar figures, in some ways. They view the world the same way. There’s also some familial connections. Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, has a longstanding relationship with Netanyahu. Netanyahu once famously spent the night at the Kushner home in New Jersey. But there’s also a political motive for Donald Trump. Donald Trump knows that his base consists partly of conservative American Jews and evangelical voters. And for their own reasons, some having to do with Israel’s biblical history, some having to do with the desire for Israel’s security, these voters believe very strongly in Netanyahu’s agenda. So to the extent that President Trump emboldens Netanyahu, he’s also really playing to this important part of his own political base.

michael barbaro So Netanyahu was very skeptical of the two-state solution from the start. And now, after 40 years of the U.S. supporting that two-state solution, Israel’s greatest ally, the one whose permission and approval it constantly seeks, is on the same page. It is now skeptical of the two-state solution.

mark landler That’s right. Netanyahu, after years of butting heads with American presidents, finally found one who not only is on the same page, but is almost reinforcing his most aggressive instincts, and it grows out of a belief on the part of both men that a mighty Israel, that a strong Israel is not only in the interest of the Israeli people, but it’s also in the American interest, a stabilizing force, an anchor of democracy in the Middle East, a counterweight to Iran, the great enemy that Trump has identified in the Middle East. But the irony is that both of these leaders, in believing that they are securing Israel’s future, securing its long-term survival and stability, may actually be undermining it.

michael barbaro How so?

mark landler Well, if you believe, as many do, that the future of Israel lies in being both genuinely a Jewish state and genuinely a democratic state, the question is can you have both?

michael barbaro What do you mean?

mark landler If you don’t have a two-state solution, if you don’t give the Palestinians their own sovereign state, you face the prospect of what people call a Greater Israel. This is the one-state solution, where Israel simply annexes all the territory on the West Bank and Gaza and becomes one nation, with both Palestinian Arabs and Jews living inside of it. And you have essentially two alternatives for how that state would look. Under one scenario, you remain a Jewish state. You don’t give Palestinians the right to vote. You essentially have a disenfranchised part of your country stretching into the future. The other alternative is you give everybody the right to vote. And under that scenario, given demographic trends, with a much faster-growing Arab population, you face the prospect of, over time, losing the Jewish character of Israel. And so that’s why I say that you can either be a Jewish state or a democratic state, but under a one-state solution, it’s very hard to see how you can be both.

michael barbaro It seems from what you’re saying that democracy is what’s being sacrificed for the maintenance of a Jewish state.

mark landler Well, at the moment, the Palestinians who live on the West Bank are a disenfranchised people. They don’t have the same rights as Israelis who live in the state of Israel. So yes, there is already a degree of disenfranchisement that is necessary to maintain Israel as it exists today. The question is whether the Israelis are willing to institutionalize that arrangement permanently, to make it a permanent feature of a future state of Israel, rather than what we have now, which is, by all accounts, still a temporary situation, an Israeli occupation that everyone hoped would someday come to an end.

michael barbaro Mark, you said that it really didn’t matter who wins the Israeli election because of these changes that both Netanyahu and President Trump were able to accomplish during their overlapping tenures, but why is this really irreversible? Couldn’t a future U.S. president after Trump essentially take back those steps, reverse them once they get into office?

mark landler Well, I think the problem is that is much easier said than done. Several of the things that President Trump did are not going to be easily undone by anyone, either a new American president or a new Israeli prime minister. Take Israel’s control of the Golan Heights. Yes, it is true that there are already hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers living in the West Bank. But by giving the Israelis some legal credibility for settling and holding onto that area and exerting sovereignty over that area, you’re only going to invite even greater construction — new houses, new schools, new communities — that will make it even more unrealistic or far-fetched to think about a viable Palestinian state being built on that territory.

michael barbaro So essentially, the reality on the ground has been changed in such a way that cannot be changed back.

mark landler Yeah, I think that’s right. These two leaders have changed the facts on the ground in a way that won’t be easily undone no matter how fervent a supporter of the two-state solution follows Donald Trump in the White House or follows Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel. They have changed the equation. They have, in a sense, retired the old paradigm.

michael barbaro Mark, thank you very much.

mark landler Thank you, Michael.

michael barbaro On Wednesday, President Trump congratulated Benjamin Netanyahu on his apparent victory, saying it means there is now a better chance of reaching a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians.

archived recording (donald trump) But everybody said you can’t have peace in the Middle East with Israel and the Palestinians. I think we have a chance, and I think we have now a better chance with Bibi having won. Yes? Please. Thank you.

michael barbaro We’ll be right back.

michael barbaro And —

archived recording We are delighted to be able to report to you today that we have seen what we thought was unseeable.

michael barbaro On Wednesday, astronomers announced that they had captured an image of what began a century ago as a mathematical concept from Albert Einstein, a cosmic abyss so deep and dense that not even light could escape it.

archived recording We have seen and taken a picture of a black hole. Here it is.

michael barbaro The image of the black hole, which has a mass several billion times larger than the sun, was captured using data from telescopes in Hawaii, Mexico, the South Pole and Spain, among other places.

archived recording Radio waves from the black hole hit radio telescopes, where they’re recorded with the precision of atomic clocks that lose only 1 second every 10 million years. When you’ve registered these radio waves so precisely, you can then store them on hard disk drives, send them to a central facility where they can be combined precisely.

michael barbaro The image settles a century-long quest to confirm that black holes actually exist, a possibility Einstein himself resisted because, according to his theory, matter, space and time are all obliterated inside a black hole.

You also may hear from me, Lindsey Underwood, editor of the newsletter. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.

Before January, I hadn’t had a Krispy Kreme doughnut or Chick-fil-A nuggets since I went gluten-free, at age 11. Those first few bites were absolute magic, but what surprised me most about going back on gluten was its effect on my social life.

What?

In sixth grade I had a host of unexplainable health issues that kept me from dancing, which was my world at the time. Desperate to get back into ballet class, I finally went off gluten and made some other dietary adjustments , at the recommendation of a naturopathic doctor. I was a bit skeptical, but when my symptoms disappeared almost overnight, I was sold on the diet.

I would get sick for a week whenever I ate gluten by accident, so I was never tempted to try it intentionally until earlier this year, when I was about to study abroad in Italy. I worried that in the land of pasta I wouldn’t have enough to eat, so before the trip I anxiously nibbled some bread. I didn’t get sick like I had in the past.

Julian Assange Arrested in London as U.S. Unseals Hacking Conspiracy Indictment,"['Charlie Savage', 'Adam Goldman', 'Eileen Sullivan']","WASHINGTON — The WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was arrested on Thursday in London to face a charge in the United States of conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer network in 2010, bringing to an abrupt end a seven-year saga in which he had holed up in Ecuador’s embassy in Britain to avoid capture.

The Ecuadorean government suspended the citizenship it had granted Mr. Assange and evicted him on Thursday, clearing the way for his arrest. His hosts had displayed growing impatience, listing grievances including recent WikiLeaks releases they said interfered with other states’ internal affairs and personal discourtesies, like the failure of Mr. Assange to clean the bathroom and look after his cat.

A bedraggled and shackled Mr. Assange, 47, was dragged out of the embassy.

Assange: A Self-Proclaimed Foe of Secrecy Who Inspires Both Admiration and Fury,"['Scott Shane', 'Steven Erlanger']","“Underground” hints at a kind of qualified idealism, suggesting that Mendax and his comrades mostly shunned theft and vandalism in favor of disclosure. The book describes “the early Australian underground’s golden rules of hacking: Don’t damage computer systems you break into (including crashing them); don’t change the information in those systems (except for altering logs to cover your tracks); and share information.”

By 2006, when he founded WikiLeaks, Mr. Assange had adopted a nomadic lifestyle, roaming the world and pronouncing sometimes cryptic principles about secrecy and information. By 2008, he was living in East Africa and exposing corruption in Kenya on the new site, which had published more than one million documents, including some from the Iraq war and the Guantánamo prison, as well as a potpourri covering less momentous topics: an early script for an Indiana Jones movie, Wesley Snipes’s tax bill and documents from the Church of Scientology and the Mormon Church.

But it was Chelsea Manning, then a low-level intelligence analyst stationed at a base in Iraq, who really put WikiLeaks, and hence Mr. Assange, on the map. Bored and harboring doubts about the war and American foreign policy, she began copying thousands of documents from a classified network onto CDs that she marked as Lady Gaga songs to avoid detection.

Back in the United States, she called both The New York Times and The Washington Post before connecting with WikiLeaks, where Mr. Assange and his fractious band of activist volunteers eagerly took up the cause in 2010.

They first posted a devastating video of two American helicopter gunships in Iraq shooting at suspected enemies on the ground — two of whom were among those killed and turned out to be war correspondents for Reuters.

"After Arrest of Julian Assange, the Russian Mysteries Remain","['Mark Mazzetti', 'Julian E. Barnes']","Numerous significant questions are left unanswered, including what, if anything, Mr. Assange knew about the identity of Guccifer 2.0, a mysterious hacker who American intelligence and law enforcement officials have identified as a front for Russian military intelligence operatives.

Court documents have revealed that it was Russian intelligence — using the Guccifer persona — that provided Mr. Assange thousands of emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of John D. Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign.

Another question is whether Mr. Assange was a conduit between the Russian hackers and the Trump campaign. Mr. Assange exchanged emails with Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Trump’s eldest son, during the campaign, and a Trump campaign official sent Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to the president, to get information about the hacked Democratic emails, according to a January indictment by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel.

Mr. Mueller concluded his investigation without an indictment that directly connected WikiLeaks, the Russians and the Trump campaign, suggesting that prosecutors did not find sufficient evidence that Mr. Assange knowingly engaged in a conspiracy with Russia to help the Trump campaign.

But the report drafted by Mr. Mueller’s team, and expected to be released next week, could have additional details about the ties between the Trump campaign and Mr. Assange.

"A Charred Gas Can, a Receipt and an Arrest in Fires of 3 Black Churches","['Alan Blinder', 'Richard Fausset', 'John Eligon']","Social media posts offered a glimpse of the man they arrested.

Facebook photos of Mr. Matthews show a young man with long hair. In one picture, he is wearing a black sleeveless T-shirt and holding a black electric guitar. He described himself as the lead singer of a black metal band called Vodka Vultures, though there was little online evidence of the band’s activity. Still, he wrote several posts that showed his familiarity with the genre.

He wrote favorably of the recent movie “Lords of Chaos,” a dramatized version of the black metal scene, and apparently referenced Varg Vikernes, perhaps the most notorious figure in the black metal movement, who was found guilty in Norway of killing a heavy metal guitarist and burning three churches.

The path to Mr. Matthews was laid out in an affidavit, with the big break coming Tuesday when an A.T.F. team found a piece of what appeared to be a two-gallon red gas can at Mount Pleasant Baptist Church.

The authorities realized that the same can was for sale at a local Walmart. On Wednesday, an investigator working for the retailer shared with them that a similar can had been purchased late on March 25 — less than three hours before the first church fire — along with a package of shop towels and a lighter, all paid for with a debit card that the authorities said was owned by Mr. Matthews.

Investigators learned, too, that Mr. Matthews’s father, Roy Matthews, was a longtime deputy in the St. Landry Parish sheriff’s office and the owner of a beige 2002 Ford pickup that appeared to match the truck that “consistently” appeared “around the time of each fire,” the affidavit states.

Sheriff Bobby Guidroz of St. Landry Parish said that he had summoned Mr. Matthews’s father on Wednesday to tell him that his son was considered a suspect in the fires, which all took place in the middle of the night and did not injure anyone.

“He was shocked and hurt, as any father would be,” Mr. Guidroz said of the older Mr. Matthews, whom he described as “a great deputy” and one of his best friends. “He was in terrible shape.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/us/11church-fires/11church-fires-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/us/holden-matthews-black-church-fires.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
White House Considered Releasing Migrants in ‘Sanctuary Cities’,"['Michael D.

"The Fall of Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the ‘Spider’ at the Heart of Sudan’s Web",['Declan Walsh'],"But global notoriety was never much of a problem for Mr. al-Bashir, 75, at home in Sudan, a vast African country with a long history of war and suffering. He outwitted rivals who underestimated him, steered a decade-long oil boom that swelled Sudan’s middle classes, and forged a network of security forces and armed militias to fight his wars that some likened to a spider’s web with Mr. al-Bashir at its center.

That carefully constructed edifice of power crumbled this week as thousands of protesters massed outside his Khartoum residence, chanting slogans and braving gunfire as rival gangs of soldiers exchanged fire. The oil money was running low, the economy was in tatters and young Sudanese, in particular, had had enough. The spider had to go.

“Just fall, that is all!” they chanted.

On Thursday morning, the military ousted him, ending his 30-year rule in the face of the sweeping demonstrations. It said it had taken Mr. al-Bashir into custody, dissolved the government and suspended the Constitution.

Representatives of the principal protest group, the Sudanese Professionals Association, which had been expecting a statement from the military and were preparing to negotiate a transition to civilian rule, greeted the announcement with disappointment.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/world/11bashir1/11bashir1-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/world/africa/omar-bashir-sudan.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
Scott Kelly Spent a Year in Orbit. His Body Is Not Quite the Same.,['Carl Zimmer'],"Or maybe it’s that the immune system, which never evolved for survival in space, simply gets confused.

“Is it good or bad? We just know it’s more,” Dr. Mason, a co-author of the new study, said of the immune activity. “To know for sure, we’d need more astronauts.”

Mr. Kelly’s return to Earth on March 1, 2016, proved to be one of the biggest moments — biologically speaking — of the whole mission. His body showed signs of intense stress, and his immune system was in high gear.

Michael Snyder, a geneticist at Stanford University and co-author of the research, cautioned that this response might not be typical. “Maybe he got a viral infection,” he speculated. “This is why you want to see it in more people.”

Despite that shock, Mr. Kelly’s body mostly returned to preflight condition. Some species of bacteria that thrived in his gut while he was in space, for example, became rare again on his landing.

The strange lengthening of Mr. Kelly’s telomeres disappeared after less than 48 hours on Earth. In fact, Dr. Bailey and her colleagues started finding many cells with telomeres that were shorter than before Mr. Kelly went to space.

“People have asked me, ‘Well, is going to space the fountain of youth?’” said Dr. Bailey. “I don’t think so.

"Falcon Heavy, SpaceX’s Giant Rocket, Launches Into Orbit, and Sticks Its Landings",['Kenneth Chang'],"Why is Falcon Heavy different from other SpaceX rockets?

The company’s workhorse is the Falcon 9 rocket, which first launched in 2010. The first stage of the Heavy essentially consists of three Falcon 9 first stages bound together. The second stages of the two rockets are identical.

The additional thrust allows the Heavy to propel 140,000 pounds to low-Earth orbit, nearly three times what the Falcon 9 can lift.

How does this Falcon Heavy differ from the first one?

On the test flight, the two side boosters were older versions reused from earlier flights. (SpaceX’s best innovation to date is landing the booster stage of its rockets and launching it again; traditionally, rockets have been one-use throwaways, with the booster stages dropped into the ocean.)

For this one, the side boosters had never before been used. They were the latest version of the rocket, called “Block Five.” (“Block” is what rocket companies call a major upgrade.) That boosts the thrust and how much the Falcon Heavy can carry.

Why did the second Falcon Heavy flight take so long?

Even though the first Falcon Heavy flight appeared to be nearly flawless, SpaceX probably made adjustments. That, after all, is the reason a rocket company performs a test flight for a new rocket design.

SpaceX also has had a backlog of Falcon 9 missions to fly. It launched 20 Falcon 9 missions in 2018, more than in any previous year, in addition to the one Falcon Heavy launch. The company was also busy at work developing its Crew Dragon capsule for taking NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station.

The market for the Falcon Heavy is also much smaller than once envisioned. When Mr. Musk first announced the rocket in 2011, he said he expected that there would be a 50/50 mix between the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy. In the years since, improvements have made the Falcon 9 more powerful, and miniaturization of electronics has shrunk the size of many satellites.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/science/11SPACEX3/11SPACEX3-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/science/falcon-heavy-launch-spacex.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
Lil Nas X’s Smash Makes Country Wonder if Rap Is Friend or Foe. Again.,['Jon Caramanica'],"The track also arrived at a fortuitous moment — on the heels of a trickle of Western aesthetics into the high-style universe over the last couple of years, and also following the success of stylistically diverse country performers like Kacey Musgraves, who have demonstrated that a country musician can be a beacon of cool far outside the genre’s walls. Even Kanye West recently took to the countryside, unveiling his last album at a Wyoming cowboy ranch.

In another moment, the aesthetic choices of “Old Town Road” might have been perceived as pure kitsch, but now they are kitsch with a side of tastemaker. And though the removal of the song from the country chart reflected an initial resentment, the mood soon switched. Some country singers said they found “Old Town Road” to be country, or country enough. They didn’t want to be on the wrong side of cool.

Billy Ray Cyrus, who joined the song’s remix, is not a country insider at the peak of his powers, but he’s still a performer with a great deal of resonance within Nashville thanks to his 1992 pop-country crossover smash “Achy Breaky Heart.” Cyrus’s “Old Town Road” verse is pure glitz, a blend of hip-hop braggadocio and country-boy-in-the-big-city awe: “Spent a lot of money on my brand-new guitar/Baby’s got a habit, diamond rings and Fendi sports bras/Ridin’ down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car.” The performance is effortless, showing a version of country music that’s cosmopolitan, flexible and self-aware.

Whether Cyrus’s co-sign will be enough for the industry side of Nashville to embrace “Old Town Road” remains to be seen. That’s because, when it comes to charts and common practices, country isn’t a genre or a set of sounds as much as it is an oligarchy, the product of a limited number of record labels; a media environment that relies heavily on radio (with programmers who can lack imagination, as female country performers have long known); and a profound bottleneck in terms of new talent and new ideas. (To be fair, country is not alone in this: In 2012, the K-pop novelty star Psy went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart with “Gangnam Style,” which was — and remains — one of the biggest viral YouTube songs in history, but was by no means a rap song in the American context.)

Nashville’s initial resistance suggests some unfortunate things about country as a genre: that it might not be able to make fun of itself; that it might look askance at outsiders, especially black performers; that it understands itself only through the lens of protecting its central ideology, and not as an omnivorous sound in dialogue with the rest of pop, and the rest of America. Country music is preoccupied with borders, and it treats each new incursion as an opportunity for identity crisis. It’s a wild contrast with contemporary hip-hop, which understands itself as music that borrows widely, and experiments with glee.

But perhaps the greatest indictment of how the country music leadership handled “Old Town Road” comes from a cursory listen to some other songs on the chart. Take “Look What God Gave Her,” the new single by Thomas Rhett, perhaps the ur-country gentleman of the last few years. It’s a soft soul song with a faint disco undertow, nothing country about it beyond the perceived affiliation of the performer. Elsewhere there are soft-rock ballads and R&B songs, none of them subject to anything like the skepticism that has greeted Lil Nas X, whose reference points might in fact be more classically country (even if refracted through a kitsch lens).",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/21/arts/21hiphop-country-promo/21hiphop-country-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-country-rap.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00

Opinion | Feeling Safe in the Surveillance State,['Jianan Qian'],"Last spring, I went back to China for a book tour that took me to six cities. Entering train stations felt like crossing border control at an international airport — my identity was confirmed not only by someone checking my documents, but also by one of the ubiquitous facial recognition cameras. One day, while a friend was driving me home after a reading in Shanghai, I saw one of them ahead of us on the highway. Well, we can no longer do “bad” things, he said, noticing my discomfort. It was supposed to be a joke, but we fell into a long, dead silence.

Many people in China seem to be happy about the physical security promised by the surveillance network. Our mind-set, long ago, was wired to see safety and freedom as an either-or choice. I remember a conversation I had during my first year in the United States, when I was visiting Chicago. A Chinese student told me he dared not walk alone in the city after 5 p.m. When I told him I’d recently taken a trip to a nearby 7-Eleven at 10 p.m. by myself to get a beer, he was shocked. “Why?” I asked him. “It’s a safe neighborhood.” Still pale, he said, “You only got lucky.”

The disappearance in June 2017 of Yingying Zhang, a young Chinese visiting scholar, from the Urbana-Champaign campus of the University of Illinois only reinforced this sense of danger everywhere outside China. Her kidnapping by a former graduate student made headlines across the country. The post that got the most shares in my WeChat feeds the week she disappeared was titled, “When you come to the States, leave behind feelings of homegrown safety. ”

The other reason that my people seem not to worry about the violation of their privacy is that they believe they are law-abiding citizens. “Only criminals need to be afraid,” they say. But I’ve heard other stories.

In 2018, Wang Qian, a young single mother from Zhejiang Province, hanged herself after she lost her savings on a peer-to-peer lending platform called PPMiao. In her suicide note, which briefly appeared on social media, she confessed her frustrations: Because she’d been a victim of a financial fraud — and therefore had grievances — she was now considered a threat to public safety and order.

[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletter to explore what’s at stake and what you can do about it.]

She said that she, as well as hundreds of other victims who’d tried to stage protests over their treatment, had been beaten by the police. One month before her suicide, investors like her who’d lost their money had planned a rally in Beijing — but only a few managed to show up, because policemen and security guards had gathered on every street corner and at subway stations to check the identity cards of everyone who was nearing Beijing’s financial district. The protest, like most of the other protests in China, was never reported in domestic news outlets.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/14/opinion/sunday/14Qian/14Qian-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/opinion/china-internet-surveillance.html,2019-04-10 00:00:00

As you can probably see, online privacy is not an absolute must for many readers: There are some acceptable trade-offs depending on the information collected, who gets to see it, how it’s shared, and maybe most important, how it’s used.

Note: Smart doorbell practices reflect those by major technology companies.

Surveys have found how many Americans are willing to make these kinds of trades, sacrificing a little privacy for a little benefit.

While it’s difficult to precisely rank privacy risks, we sorted our scenarios (some real, some that we can imagine happening soon) from most to least invasive based on conversations with experts. Judging whether a practice is “invasive” isn’t a science, of course. It’s more like a gut feeling, and it depends on how you feel about your own privacy, how much you value strangers’ privacy and the trust you have in corporations and law enforcement.

But the results also emphasize a quirk in our digital behavior: People rarely change what they do online, even when they express serious concerns about how their data is used. This is sometimes called the privacy paradox.

“One of the reasons people say one thing and do another is they don’t know what’s going on,” said Lee Rainie, the director of internet and technology research at the Pew Research Center. “It’s not that they’re being hypocritical, or that they’re mouthing one thing and immediately dismissing it in another moment. It’s that they don’t actually know.”

Researchers studying the paradox say internet companies make it hard for users to judge their privacy risks. Users might feel like they have no choice but to use services like email or social networks. The sites might also make it hard to learn about all of their data practices. Facebook, for example, has a lengthy Data Policy, but it’s written so broadly that it's nearly impossible to figure out what exactly they do with your data. Just signing up for a digital service often means consenting to all kinds of data use and collection.

Under those conditions, is it surprising people aren’t changing their behavior?

Trusting Social Media

The paradox is clearest with social media, which has been a focus of privacy concerns for decades. Facebook, for example, has endured a barrage of bad press over the past few years, including the fallout from Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a political consulting company harvested information from millions of unsuspecting users to build detailed profiles on voters (a practice it ended in 2015). Even so, Facebook reported late last year that its number of daily active users in the United States and Canada remained steady at 185 million.

Until recently, Facebook did a version of many of the practices listed here.

Does Facebook do this, or has it? if you provide it collects personal information about me uses friends' posts to send me targeted advertisements lets companies upload customer lists so they can send me targeted advertising until April 2018 buys information about me from third parties on some sites receives details about my activity from other websites at some retailers receives information on what I buy in physical stores after granting permission lets third parties download basic information on my friends without their consent until April 2015 (after granting permission) lets third parties download information on my friends, like their relationship status and interests, without their consent it was tested in 2016 serves me targeted ads on a smart TV app that has a relationship with the website if you enable location services might know when I walk into into a physical store using the location I share with the phone app

So far, percent of our readers were comfortable with sites collecting personal data. But that doesn’t mean those basic practices come without risk. Agreeing to those basic kinds of data collection enrolls users in Facebook's entire data ecosystem.

Artificial intelligence “can make all of these things far worse,” added Joseph Turow, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the lead author on a 2018 study about modern surveillance. He said running machine learning — a branch of artificial intelligence — on basic information collected by social networks can allow them to “infer things that I couldn’t even imagine a company could learn.”

New Privacy Frontier: DNA

Is this already happening? uses my DNA to offer clues about my genealogy uses my DNA to determine specific health risks like cancer uses data from surveys I complete on the site to build a richer profile about me if you opt in invites me to participate in pharmaceutical research if my DNA profile matches research needs if you opt in sells an analysis of my anonymous/aggregated DNA profile to third parties if you opt in uses my DNA profile to conduct research on behalf of pharma companies if you opt in sells my anonymous DNA profile to third parties as part of paid research projects if you opt in lets customers identify relatives by matching DNA to other customers lets law enforcement agencies register as users, which lets them look for criminals by matching DNA profiles (without a warrant)

Genetic companies like 23andMe and Ancestry analyze customer DNA to provide clues about genealogy and health risks. But the data also offers another potential revenue stream: repackaging it as valuable data for pharmaceutical companies, colleges and researchers.

Both 23andMe and Ancestry allow customers to opt into research collaborations with third parties — relationships the companies say will lead to scientific breakthroughs.

Ancestry said it has no current for-profit ventures and only one nonprofit collaboration with the University of Utah. But in 2015, it partnered with the biotech research company Calico to analyze anonymized data from its trove of genetic samples and, possibly, commercialize their findings.

The deal ended last year, and its financial terms were never released.

23andMe said it’s currently partnering with pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline and recently collaborated with Genentech, a subsidiary of the Swiss pharma giant Roche. Past collaborations also include Grunenthal, Celmatix, Lundbeck and Milken Institute, and two with Pfizer.

The company said the vast majority of their partnerships use de-identified and aggregated data (so it’s pooled with other genetic profiles and summarized, removing identifying information). Other collaborations involved sharing parts of your DNA profile, stripped of additional identifying information like your name. 23andMe emphasized they provide several different opt-ins and consent forms before customers are enrolled. But privacy experts have questioned whether consenting to long documents full of legal terms is the best approach.

“The classic notice-and-consent regime that has been the anchor of all kinds of things — not just online transactions but who’s in medical trials and who is getting what kind of medical treatments – that regime is a complicated one,” said Mr. Rainie. “Especially when there are lots of little encounters, lots of little transactions, where a notice-and-consent format might be implicated, people are confused by all of this.”

In our poll, percent of readers were comfortable with pharmaceutical companies profiting from their genetic material.

Context and Combinations Matter

Is this already happening? in at least some schools uses facial recognition to match my face against a list of employees in my workplace planned for a Brooklyn building checks my face against a database of tenants in my apartment building tool is being marketed checks my face against a database of known shoplifters in a Walgreens pilot uses facial analysis to determine my age and gender in a Walgreens pilot tracks where I look in a store not in real time allows police to match my face against a mugshot database not in real time allows police to match my faces against a driver's license database an Israeli company claims to do this interprets the features on my face to guess other attributes about me in a pilot project monitors major roads or bridges 24/7 in the U.K. lets police departments scan crowds in real time in New York, according to a news report watches a subsidized housing project to identify people

All facial recognition practices listed here are happening somewhere in the world today, signalling how A.I. can be combined with video surveillance to create new privacy risks. New York City experimented with using facial recognition on drivers as they crossed bridges and tunnels around Manhattan. And an Israeli startup claims to be able to identify specific attributes like “high IQ” or “terrorist.” But in most cases, it’s hard to know exactly where and how the burgeoning technology is being used.

“For all of these, we know the capability is being advertised, but don't necessarily know if anyone is using the technology for that purpose,” said Clare Garvie, senior associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University Law Center.

While each piece of technology in our poll comes with some privacy risks, the most invasive applications can come when those technologies are used in tandem like this.

It’s possible to imagine how combining facial recognition with drones, or connecting it to a citywide network of real-time cameras, could suddenly make the technology far more invasive.

“It’s not the individual collections of online activity that’s the problem,” said Bruce Schneier, a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School and author of “Data and Goliath: The Hidden Battles to Collect Your Data and Control Your World.” “It’s the correlation of offline activity, and location, and income estimates, and so on. It’s not cameras on drones, it’s cameras on drones plus automatic face recognition, plus activity monitoring, plus predictive behavioral algorithms. It’s not any one individual privacy invasion – it’s all of them used together.”

Opinion | How The Times Thinks About Privacy,['A. G. Sulzberger'],"The Times, like many of these organizations, maintains clear internal guidelines about how such data is collected and used. But this control is often more limited than it seems because, in many cases, the news organizations that host the trackers don’t know what happens with that information once it is transferred to third parties. Those companies range from major platforms like Google and Facebook, to smaller companies you’ve never heard of that act as analytics providers and advertising intermediaries, to the individual companies that place individual advertisements. Readers may understandably wonder: What data do these companies have? To whom might they sell it? How might those buyers exploit it?

I ask myself those questions, too, as a publisher and as a person who uses the internet. As a journalist, I deeply believe that society benefits from the type of free-flowing information that overly broad privacy regulations could unintentionally impede. Our reporting often relies on leaks from whistle-blowers, personal communications of government officials obtained through records requests and computer-driven analysis of huge sets of data. But I’m also a person who values his own privacy — I have virtually no presence on social media — and I share the anxiety and mixed feelings that many have about the systematic collection, warehousing and sharing of personal data.

It’s clear that the rapid increase in data collection has resulted in many worthy contributions: creating a more interconnected world, saving users untold amounts of time and money, driving business and innovation and enabling important advances, from identifying public health threats to foiling terrorist attacks. But it’s also increasingly clear those benefits come with costs and trade-offs that society has not really reckoned with. People have little transparency into what is being gathered, where it’s being shared and how it’s being used — to follow their movements, to charge them more for health insurance or to manipulate them with political messages — and even less agency to do anything about it.

[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletter to explore what’s at stake and what you can do about it.]

Countless companies are wrestling with these trade-offs, many of them doing the best they can within a digital ecosystem they can’t hope to unilaterally reform. The internet doesn’t have to be this way. But change needs to be driven at a societal level — by politicians, leaders of major technology companies and the public at large.

While we’d welcome such change, we’re not waiting for it. The Times is committed to continue taking steps to increase transparency and protections. And our journalists will do their part to ensure that the public and policymakers are fully informed by covering these issues aggressively, fairly and accurately. Over the coming months, The Privacy Project will feature reporters investigating how digital privacy is being compromised, Op-Ed editors bringing in outside voices to help foster debate and contextualize trade-offs, and opinion writers calling for solutions. All of us at The Times will be reading closely as well, using their findings to help inform the continuing evolution of our own policies and practices.

Opinion | Our Disgrace at the Border,['David Brooks'],"On the one hand, these people are our neighbors. Many of them come to us with harrowing stories of husbands murdered, daughters raped, mass extortion. It’s our obligation and joy to reach out to them with a hand of solidarity. It’s barbarism to send them back to lawlessness.

On the other hand, many who are coming across seeking asylum do not qualify for it. When they get their hearings, only 20 percent win the right to stay in the United States because they’d face persecution in their home countries. Many come for traditional economic reasons. The murder rate in El Salvador has fallen in half since 2015, while the number of asylum seekers has skyrocketed.

The U.S. cannot take in everybody who wants to come. So the first task is to set priorities. The victims of violence and persecution get top priority, then those being systemically denied their basic rights because their country has become a failed state, then those seeking economic betterment.

Then you create a system to implement those priorities. Over the short term do the things any practical mayor would do: build new detention centers at the border; expand the capacities at the ports of entry; expand the number of judge teams, to speed through the backlog; create an orderly release procedure coordinated with humanitarian agencies; increase the number of counselors so refugees can navigate the system; vet children in their home countries for refugee status so they don’t have to make a fruitless trip.

Over the long term, you help build better police and justice systems in the home countries. You cooperate with Mexico to jointly tackle this challenge we face together. You might shift to a more skills-based immigration system while increasing the number of refugees we take in each year.

Designing a practical response that wins widespread support is, in theory, not hard. But it requires starting with a certain question: What can we do to help them? Much of today’s politics starts from a different question: What posture can I adopt that will reflect well on me? What can I say to prove I’m manly or woke?

This is what happens when the politics of practical action get replaced by the politics of performative narcissism.

Opinion | Is Assange’s Arrest a Threat to the Free Press?,['Michelle Goldberg'],"But the Justice Department’s desire to nail Assange for publishing information leaked by Manning never went away. Miller said that both former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wanted to take a new look at the case. It’s a relief that they found a way to make the case without a frontal assault on journalistic prerogatives. Still, if you read the indictment, a lot of things that journalists do routinely are part of Assange’s alleged crime.

“It was part of the conspiracy that Assange and Manning took measures to conceal Manning as the source of the disclosure of classified records to WikiLeaks,” says the indictment. Most if not all investigative journalists take such measures to protect their sources. The indictment says, “It was part of the conspiracy that Assange encouraged Manning to provide information and records from departments and agencies of the United States.” Journalists often do this when they urge whistle-blowers to come forward. “It was part of the conspiracy that Assange and Manning used a special folder on a cloud drop box of WikiLeaks” to transmit classified information, the indictment continues. Like many news organizations, The New York Times does something similar, soliciting tips through an encrypted submission system called SecureDrop.

For any of these actions to become part of a criminal conspiracy, there has to be a crime. But as Georgetown law professor David Super points out, “We have right now a criminal code that is bursting at the seams with offenses,” making it easy to break laws without realizing it.

A prosecutor, then, might be able to find a pretext for a similar conspiracy case if, for example, someone decides to leak the Mueller report, or Trump’s tax returns. “This pattern of behavior has already been turned against journalists in many parts of the world,” Super said. Journalists “get prosecuted for pretty mundane stuff, some of which they probably did, but they wouldn’t have been charged for if they didn’t make the regime unhappy.”

Assange seems to have thought that, by helping elect Trump, he would improve his own situation. As Julia Ioffe reported in The Atlantic, in 2016 WikiLeaks suggested to Donald Trump Jr. that Trump should lean on Australia to have Assange, an Australian citizen, appointed ambassador to the United States. Roger Stone, a Trump adviser who was indicted in part for lying about his communications with WikiLeaks, reportedly told an associate that he was trying to get Assange a pre-emptive presidential pardon. Now Assange has discovered, as so many others have before him, that betting on Trump can ruin your life. There’s a certain dark satisfaction in that. But any legal theory that Trump’s Justice Department uses against Assange can also be used against the rest of us.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/12/opinion/12goldbergWeb/12goldbergWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/opinion/julian-assange-wikileaks-first-amendment.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
"Opinion | Purity vs. Pragmatism, Environment vs. Health",['Paul Krugman'],"Right now there are two big progressive ideas out there: the Green New Deal on climate change and “Medicare for all” on health reform. Both would move U.S. policy significantly to the left. Each is sponsored by a self-proclaimed socialist: the Green New Deal by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Medicare for all by Bernie Sanders. (Of course, neither of them is a socialist in the traditional sense.) Both ideas horrify not just conservatives but also many self-proclaimed centrists.

Yet while they may seem similar if you think of everything as left versus right, they’re very different on another dimension, which you might call purity versus pragmatism. And that difference is why I believe progressives should enthusiastically embrace the G.N.D. while being much more cautious about M4A.

You see, for all its sweeping ambition, the Green New Deal is arguably an exercise in pragmatism — in the proposition that the perfect is the enemy of the good.

What’s the perfect in this case? Climate-policy purists are focused on the notion of a carbon tax to discourage greenhouse gas emissions, and they look down on any proposal that doesn’t put such a tax front and center.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/opinion/11krugman1/11krugman1-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/opinion/green-new-deal-medicare-for-all.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
Opinion | ‘Curious Eyes Never Run Dry’,['The Editorial Board'],"The arrest in London of the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange ends one bizarre saga, but opens a legal drama that is likely to stretch over many years and could probe uncharted areas of press freedoms and national security in the United States in the digital era. There is good reason to be watchful as the case unfolds.

Mr. Assange, a 47-year-old Australian, had spent almost seven years holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy, initially to avoid arrest on Swedish sex charges that have since been dropped , then British charges of skipping bail. But extradition to the United States was what Mr. Assange really feared, and what the cat-and-mouse game was always about.

It was in the United States that the materials posted on WikiLeaks created the greatest furor, first through the publication of a trove of classified documents supplied by an Army private, Chelsea Manning, and then by releasing material stolen from the computers of Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

The Obama administration was wary of pursuing Mr. Assange because WikiLeaks was essentially involved in investigative work common to a free press. But the Trump administration saw Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks as targets as soon as it took office. (Mr. Trump loved WikiLeaks in 2016 when it was embarrassing top officials of the Clinton campaign.) Two years ago , as director of the C.I.A., Mike Pompeo labeled WikiLeaks “a nonstate hostile intelligence service” after it released a cache of C.I.A. hacking tools. Efforts got underway then to build a case against Mr. Assange. This was confirmed through an inadvertent mention in a federal court filing last November.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/opinion/11Assange/11Assange-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/opinion/assange-wikileaks-arrest.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
Opinion | Thomas Edison Would Not Be Happy,"['C. Barry Edison Sloane', 'J. Heywood Edison Sloane']","The new standards, which would require these bulbs to be as efficient as widely used pear-shaped bulbs and would phase out inefficient incandescents and halogens, were approved in 2017 in the waning days of the Obama administration after a rule-making process of more than two years. Manufacturers and retailers have been preparing since then for the new rules to become effective on Jan. 1, 2020.

Unfortunately, the Trump administration plans to step back from that decision and exempt these bulbs from the standards. If that happens, American consumers will miss out on an estimated $12 billion in annual savings on their utility bills, or about $100 for each household, according to the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. It also means more electricity will need to be generated — 25 coal-burning 500-megawatt power plants’ worth, based on calculations by the Natural Resources Defense Council, creating the same amount of pollution that spews from the tailpipes of seven million cars a year.

The European Union has already banned incandescent and halogen bulbs, and many developing countries are in the process of doing the same, which means America could become a dumping ground for cheap, energy-wasting bulbs.

Congress and the public need to register their strong opposition with the Energy Department by May 3 to increase the odds that the agency will do the right thing and maintain these new energy-saving standards, not narrow their scope.

In addition to abandoning the standards on those incandescent and halogen bulbs, the Trump administration may opt to not enforce standards that require traditional pear-shaped bulbs and others to be at least 65 percent to 70 percent more efficient than old incandescents, beginning next year. The state of California imposed such a requirement last year, but an Energy Department lawyer testified at an administrative hearing in February that the department did not consider itself obligated to do so nationally, though a decision had not been made.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/opinion/11Sloane2/11Sloane2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,[],http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/opinion/energy-efficiency-trump-light.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
Opinion | ‘What’s Your Favorite Book?’ Is Not a Trick Question,['Jennifer Weiner'],"One of my fondest memories of motherhood is of when my younger daughter, Phoebe, learned to read. It was bedtime, and her sister, her stepfather and I were settled in bed with our books. I kissed Phoebe good night and left the light on, and as I walked down the hall I heard her announce, “I am part of the reading family now!” (I felt good about my parenting, in a way I hadn’t since the incident, a few weeks previously, when, on our way to a doctor’s appointment, my other kid looked up at me with a sunny smile and announced, “Guess what I am not wearing today!”)

As an author and a lifelong reader, a girl who found refuge in books, I am glad that my children are part of the reading family. Many Americans are not. According to the Pew Foundation, almost a quarter of Americans said they had not read a book in the previous 12 months.

My guess is that school is to blame. Somewhere along the way, between “Beowulf” and Chaucer, people learned that reading was a slog and that literature consisted of books about characters who looked and sounded nothing like them, living in worlds that were nothing like their own. Reading was a duty and not a pleasure. And so, as soon as no one was forcing them to do it, they stopped.

The list of books that most schools still consider required reading — the canon, still heavy on dead, white, male authors — doesn’t help. Nor does the way some cultural gatekeepers, many of them proudly progressive and reflexively inclusive in other parts of their lives, seem invested in keeping the ranks of readers closed.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/opinion/11weiner/11weiner-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/opinion/favorite-books-romance-politics.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
An Artist Colony Thrives in the South African Desert,['Joseph Berger'],"There were works by local artists like J.P. Martin, who paints blurry, sepia-toned scenes of men and boys in athletic poses. Watershed also sells pillows whose covers feature more whimsical Schadeberg photographs like that of an African jazz trio wreathed in a nightclub’s cigarette smoke. We came away with a shapely ceramic vase whose design of pink flecks was created by Mr. Martin. It now sits in our living room.

Prince Albert is home to 30 painters, sculptors, designers and crafts makers, Mr. Steiner, Watershed’s owner, informed us. They are drawn by the village’s serenity and seclusion. Their paintings and sculptures are available down the main road at the Gallery, which also has a busy cafe.

From rock paintings to typewriters

When I asked Mr. Steiner when Prince Albert became an artist’s colony, his answer was gently admonishing of a Western perspective: “The first artists to make their mark,” he said, “were the Khoi-San who interpreted this arid ancient stretch of territory on the walls of caves and rock faces.”

Khoi-San is the catchall term for two groups of southern Africa’s indigenous blacks who are not speakers of Bantu languages, as the majority Zulu and Xhosa are. Known for the clicking sounds of their consonants, they had herded, foraged and hunted along the Swartberg slopes for thousands of years until they were gradually displaced by Bantu expansion some 1,500 years ago, and then pushed out by musket-wielding white settlers in the mid-18th century. The settlers derogatorily called them Hottentots (Khoi) and Bushmen (San). Their descendants today number about 400,000 and are scattered around southern Africa, principally in arid areas like the Kalahari.

The Fransie Pienaar Museum has photographs of rock paintings but is short on Khoi-San history. Rock paintings, which were done with ingredients like eland blood and egg white, depict elephants, eland and other animals as well as processions of hunters and other scenes of daily life. For those who have the time, there are a number of areas across South Africa where a visitor can see actual rock paintings, a prime location being the Cederberg mountain range two hours north of Cape Town. It has more than 500 painting sites, including a two-and-a-half mile rock-art trail and others accessible by hikers.

The rooms of the Pienaar museum chronicle the story of Prince Albert’s “founding” in 1762, a century after Dutch traders first came to this part of Africa, and are stuffed with 19th- and early-20th-century tools, dishware, telephones, typewriters, musical instruments, guns and other settler gadgets. After crossing the Karoo (a Khoisan word meaning desert) by wagon, the farmers Zacharias and Dina De Beer planted fruit orchards, vineyards and wheat fields. Other farmers followed and by 1855 the village could support a Dutch Reformed minister. A steepled church was built 10 years later, and it still dominates the village.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/14/travel/31princealbert1/31princealbert1-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/travel/prince-albert-south-africa-artist-colony.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
Magic Johnson Always Set His Sights Beyond Basketball,"['Marc Stein', 'Sopan Deb']","After last summer’s blockbuster signing of LeBron James, Johnson proclaimed the Lakers to be “back” — with the promise of a return to full “back back” status this summer once they acquired at least one superstar sidekick to James. Johnson has instead fled just when the most crucial work was about to commence, with no clear path to bringing that second star to a flailing franchise that last reached the playoffs in 2013 and last won a championship in 2010.

When he convened an impromptu news conference Tuesday night, rather than reveal his updated plan to restore the Lakers to title contention and placate a frustrated fan base, Johnson did just the opposite. Describing himself as “happier when I wasn’t the president,” he explained that the conditions and pressures attached to building a championship team around James meant that the real Magic “couldn’t come out.”

In a series of rambling interviews with a number of news outlets while the Lakers were in the process of losing their regular-season finale to the Portland Trail Blazers, Johnson spoke of how he had longed to send a congratulatory tweet to Oklahoma City’s Russell Westbrook or to tutor Ben Simmons, the rising Philadelphia 76ers star, without inciting a storm of tampering allegations.

“I knew if I stayed in the role,” he said, “I’m giving up a lot of me.”

Such disclosures, of course, only served to validate much of the skepticism that greeted Buss’s decision to install Johnson as the new face of the Lakers’ basketball operations in February 2017.

Rival front-office executives questioned Johnson’s lack of experience in the modern game and his willingness to embrace the all-encompassing nature of the job from the moment he was named to replace the much-maligned Jim Buss (Jeanie’s brother) and Mitch Kupchak, the longtime Lakers executive. Those questions only rose in volume when Buss named as Magic’s sidekick another front-office neophyte, Rob Pelinka, Kobe Bryant’s polarizing former agent.

There were red flags from the start. In taking on his first active role with an N.B.A. team since his second retirement as a player in 1996, Johnson admitted that he had much to learn about navigating the ins and outs of the N.B.A.’s complex salary cap and the rhythms of a job that had evolved so much in his time away.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/sports/11magic1/merlin_153299928_68145273-94c0-44bb-b1d0-1ec55f21a9a1-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/sports/magic-johnson-lakers.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
I Thought I Could Serve as an Openly Gay Man in the Army. Then Came the Death Threats.,['Necko L. Fanning'],"The second week after I arrived at Fort Drum, N.Y. — my first and only duty station with the Army — I found death threats slipped under the door of my barracks room. I noticed the colors first. Pink, blue and yellow; strangely happy colors at odds with the words written on them. Some were simple: slurs and epithets written in thick black Sharpie, pressed so hard into the paper that it bled through. “Faggot” and “queer fag,” the notes read. A couple were more elaborate: detailed descriptions of what might happen to me if I was caught alone, and proclamations about the wrongness of gays in the military.

I read the most detailed descriptions over again, trying to explain them away as something other than what they were. Maybe they were a joke, or meant for someone else. I reached for my phone and then stopped. If I reported these and they were only a joke, then I would become “that guy.” Taking ridicule — smiling at the most vile and offensive slights with the understanding that they were nothing more than jokes — is the most important social capital in the military. Was I willing to risk losing that capital before I had the chance to earn it? I tore the bright sticky notes into confetti and tossed them into the trash.

The military is built on a foundation of earning trust and proving yourself to your peers and superiors as capable. Being new to a unit isn’t unlike being a new employee at any other job. People are cautious, even wary, until you’ve shown you can handle the work. Perhaps it didn’t help that I was an intelligence analyst in an infantryman’s world — a support soldier in a combat soldier’s unit. But none of that had been mentioned in the notes. My capability wasn’t in question, nor was my duty position. It wasn’t my effectiveness or value to the unit that elicited these noxious notes but something far removed from my control. Something that after September 2011 was supposed to be meaningless.

After a few months at Fort Drum, I discovered a group that convened for secret support meetings. No two people were similar — a woman who had been in the service nearly as long as I had been alive, a married father, an infantry soldier a rank below me. Each person identified as something other than heterosexual, but only privately. In their everyday lives, they pretended to be straight. We met in different places — in barracks rooms and offices after hours — but always in secret. Sometimes it was to console or commiserate. Other times I think it was to simply know that we weren’t alone.

During these meetings I always talked about my anxiety over not knowing who had written those sticky notes and if they were standing next to me in formation or would be the person I sat beside, alone, on my next 24-hour shift. The others revealed truths I considered much darker than my own: The woman spoke about the sexual assault she never reported during the time of “don’t ask, don’t tell” for fear that an investigation would unveil that she was a lesbian; the husband spoke about feeling trapped but fearing that revealing himself would cost him everything; and the infantryman confessed that he drank himself to sleep because he could never claim what he was aloud. At least I hadn’t had to endure any of their horrors, I would think. Remembering this was sometimes helpful — as if I were seeing things with greater perspective, finding the silver lining. Other times it made me nearly sick with shame to compare my fears with theirs. But I never stopped going.

I left the Army in December 2014, but I still feel as if I am coming to terms with my identity. There are moments when it feels wrong to claim my status as a veteran; as if being gay made me less of a soldier and somehow invalidated my service. These moments of vulnerability bring me back to when one of my superiors told me not to bring a date to the military ball; to when I found “Fag” spelled out in the snow on my windshield with urine; to all the times I avoided those who showed me compassion, for fear that it was a trick and that they had been the one to slip the notes beneath my door. Every memory evokes an emotion: rage that I had to serve with a constant sense of fear of my fellow soldiers; paralyzing sadness for those who endured abuses worse than I can know; and, the worst, guilt over the service members — gay or straight or transgender — who died while serving in the military while my body is still whole.

I don’t know if these feelings will ever go away. But it is when the guilt is most crippling that I remember my support group. That chance to share an unseen pain and know there were others like me struggling each day still helps me wake up each morning, pull on my boots and go about my day.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/10/magazine/10atwar-lgbt/10atwar-lgbt-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/magazine/lgbt-military-army.html,2019-04-10 00:00:00
I Thought I Could Serve as an Openly Gay Man in the Army. Then Came the Death Threats.,['Necko L. Fanning'],"The second week after I arrived at Fort Drum, N.Y. — my first and only duty station with the Army — I found death threats slipped under the door of my barracks room. I noticed the colors first. Pink, blue and yellow; strangely happy colors at odds with the words written on them. Some were simple: slurs and epithets written in thick black Sharpie, pressed so hard into the paper that it bled through. “Faggot” and “queer fag,” the notes read.

Netanyahu Won. The Two-State Solution Lost.,[],"Benjamin Netanyahu is poised to form Israel’s next government. With President Trump on his side, a peace deal with the Palestinians seems more elusive than ever.

michael barbaro From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: Donald Trump has promised to broker the deal of the century between Israelis and Palestinians. His partnership with Benjamin Netanyahu has made such a peace deal all but impossible. It’s Thursday, April 11.

archived recording All right, breaking news, critical elections in Israel.

mark landler So on Tuesday morning, Israeli voters woke up and went to the polls in what was by all accounts one of the closest Israeli elections in years.

archived recording Current prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scandal-plagued and facing indictment on fraud and corruption charges, faced centrist candidate General Benny Gantz.

mark landler It pitted the veteran, longtime prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu against an opponent, Benny Gantz, who was actually far more competitive than anyone Netanyahu has faced for some time.

michael barbaro Mark Landler covers the White House for The Times. And indeed, as the voting played out —

archived recording 1 Israel held one of its most consequential elections in decades, and as of right now, it’s not quite clear who’s the winner. archived recording 2 It’s a very close race. It’s a very dramatic election. archived recording 3 This has shaped up, really, to be, frankly, the fight of Mr. Netanyahu’s political life.

mark landler — over the course of the day, and the first exit polls came out, it looked like it was a virtual dead heat.

archived recording (benjamin netanyahu) [SPEAKING HEBREW] archived recording (interpreter) This is a night of a tremendous victory.

mark landler You had both Gantz and Netanyahu claiming victory —

archived recording (benny gantz) [SPEAKING HEBREW] archived recording (interpreter) In elections, there are losers. In elections, there are winners, and we are the winners.

mark landler — in separate rallies on Tuesday evening.

archived recording Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has apparently won an historic fifth term after a tight election race.

mark landler But as the counting inched forward later on Tuesday evening, it became clear that Netanyahu had gotten just enough votes that he was probably going to be able to put together a right-wing coalition and continue in government, a feat that is, by all accounts, remarkable. It would make him, in just a few months, the longest-serving Israeli prime minister since Ben-Gurion and really a commanding figure on the Israeli political stage.

archived recording [HEBREW CHANTING]

mark landler But for all the drama and all the theatrics and all the history that was made in Israel this week, in one important respect, the election actually doesn’t change much. The two-state solution, the solution to end the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, this holy grail of diplomacy that the United States has been working toward for the last four decades is, for all intents and purposes, dead.

archived recording On the 29th of November, 1947, the United Nations voted to establish two states, one Jewish, one Arab, in a partitioned Palestine.

mark landler The dilemma that has faced Israel since its founding in the 1940s was that the land that the Israelis occupied, the ancestral homeland for the Jewish people, was land that was actually also claimed by the Palestinians.

archived recording Directly after the United Nations decision to partition Palestine, the euphoric dream of Jewish statehood in the land of Israel was punctured by the harsh reality of gunfire.

mark landler So what peacemakers have tried to do is figure out if there’s a way to create a separate homeland, a separate state for the Palestinians, one where they would manage their own affairs, enjoy the benefits of self-rule, but live in peace with their neighbors, the Israelis.

archived recording For the third time since its birth as an independent state, Israel is embroiled in a war with the Arab nations that surround it.

mark landler This task became more and more difficult over the years —

archived recording The Israeli spearheads race to the Gaza Strip, advance across the entire Sinai.

mark landler — because through wars and other conquests, the Israelis began to occupy more and more of the land that would form the basis for a Palestinian state.

archived recording A six-day Middle East war echoes along a second front: a diplomatic struggle at the United Nations Security Council.

mark landler And so the really difficult task the peacemakers have had is seeing what kind of formula they could strike that would give the Palestinians enough territory to have a viable state but leave the Israeli state feeling it had adequate security for its own people. And this is what peacemakers, Israelis and American, refer to as the two-state solution.

michael barbaro And how has the U.S. viewed that plan, the two-state solution, historically?

archived recording (bill clinton) Finally, the time is approaching when there will be safety in Israel’s house, when the Palestinian people will write their own destiny, when the clash of arms will be banished from God’s Holy Land.

mark landler Well, the United States has, since early in the Clinton administration, formally set as a policy objective the creation of a Palestinian state, a two-state solution to the conflict.

archived recording (richard nixon) I would say that a profound and, I believe, lasting change has taken place.

mark landler But even before then, going all the way back to the Nixon years, the general push of American policy has been to try to find a solution that would give the Palestinians some kind of homeland.

archived recording (richard nixon) Where there was no hope for peace, there is now hope.

michael barbaro And Mark, just so I understand, why does the U.S. feel strongly about a two-state solution, and why does it care about it?

mark landler I think for a couple of reasons. One is a legal reason. Israel took the land in the West Bank by force in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. This move was condemned widely by the United Nations, by other countries, and even by the United States as an unlawful seizure or conquest of territory. So resolving the status of the West Bank is important from an international law perspective. But beyond that, there is a more important recognition here, which is until and unless we can offer the Palestinian people some sense of homeland, they’re always going to be displaced, unhappy, and they pose a threat not only to Israel, their occupying force, but to other countries in the region. So there’s a sense to which the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is kind of this low-grade powder keg that could explode at any time and bring the rest of the region around it into conflict.

michael barbaro And how does Israel respond to this decades-long push from the U.S. and the rest of the world for a two-state solution?

mark landler Well, it depends very much on who’s in government, but the general trend line in Israel is that early in this process, many Israelis felt that the two-state solution was the only solution to their problem. There was a great deal of sympathy and support in Israel for a two-state solution, not just on the Israeli left, but on the right. But then Benjamin Netanyahu is elected prime minister, and Netanyahu sets in motion a series of programs and policies that have the effect of hardening Israeli attitudes against the desirability of a two-state solution. He really builds up the Israeli economy. He makes Israel a powerhouse in the region. He builds up Israel’s military. He makes Israelis feel, for the first time, more secure. He builds a wall between Israel and the West Bank. So he literally walls off Israelis from the problem of the Palestinians. And by making it easier to turn away from the Palestinians, he contributes to and accelerates this hardening of attitudes in Israel that makes Israelis not just on the right, but, to some extent, on the left, as well, view the two-state solution as a less urgent priority — as something that’s less necessary, less desirable.

michael barbaro And how did the U.S. respond to Netanyahu and to this hardening against the two-state solution that he represented?

mark landler Well, the United States, under Republican and Democratic presidents, has been adamant in their support of a two-state solution. So from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Barack Obama, you had a series of presidents who always pushed against what they viewed as Israeli efforts to undermine a two-state solution — for example, the building of Jewish settlements on the West Bank. Every time the Israelis announced they were building a new settlement, you could count on the White House to issue a statement condemning it.

michael barbaro Because it violated the notion that the Palestinians would have a full state of their own someday?

mark landler Indeed, because merely by putting a Jewish community into what would someday be Palestinian territory, you are undermining the viability of a future state. And so this was a very consistent policy. It was really nonpartisan. Republicans and Democrats supported it. It was an article of faith in the American foreign policy community and a feature of our diplomacy up until Donald Trump became president.

michael barbaro And what did President Trump do differently than his predecessors?

archived recording In your vision for the new Middle East peace, are you ready to give up on the notion of a two-state solution?

mark landler Well, for one thing, the first time President Trump is asked publicly what solution he prefers to resolve the conflict, he says —

archived recording (donald trump) So I’m looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like. I’m very happy with the one that both —

mark landler I’m in favor of a two-state solution, a one-state solution, whatever the two sides want. Later on, he then comes around, months later, and says —

archived recording — say something — [INTERPOSING VOICES] archived recording (donald trump) I like two-state solution.

mark landler I do like a two-state solution.

archived recording (donald trump) That’s what I think works best. I don’t even have to speak to anybody, but that’s my feeling.

mark landler But his commitment to it is always far looser, far flimsier, than any of his predecessors.

archived recording (donald trump) We want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.

mark landler So Donald Trump’s words are sort of all over the place, but his actions are far clearer. What he does, in effect, is he backs up Netanyahu to the hilt. All the actions that Netanyahu wants to do, which would have drawn objections from Trump’s predecessors — he basically gives Netanyahu a blank check. And he himself authorizes several important changes in policy that have the effect of accelerating the undermining of a future Palestinian state.

michael barbaro And what are those changes?

mark landler Well, Trump started off —

archived recording (donald trump) Thank you.

mark landler — by delivering on a campaign promise —

archived recording (donald trump) Therefore, I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

mark landler — to move the United States Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And the reason this was really significant is that the status of Jerusalem is itself contested. Palestinians aspire to having East Jerusalem be the capital of their future state. The administration moves the embassy to Jerusalem, and they don’t, in moving it, make the point that they still view East Jerusalem as a potential Palestinian capital.

archived recording (donald trump) Israel is a sovereign nation with the right, like every other sovereign nation, to determine its own capital.

mark landler They merely declare that the time has come to recognize reality, which is that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.

archived recording (donald trump) God bless you. God bless Israel. God bless the Palestinians. And God bless the United States. Thank you very much.

michael barbaro And in so doing, seem to say it’s not the capital of the future Palestinian state.

mark landler It would seem to foreclose the possibility of having East Jerusalem be the Palestinian capital.

michael barbaro O.K.

archived recording (donald trump) Did you ever talk about the vast amounts of funds, money, that we give to the Palestinians? We give hundreds of millions of dollars.

mark landler The next thing that President Trump does is —

archived recording (donald trump) That money is on the table. That money is not going to them unless they sit down and negotiate peace.

mark landler He cuts aid to the Palestinian Authority, to the United Nations agency that helps Palestinian refugees.

archived recording Today, the Department of State will announce the closure of the Palestine Liberation Organization office here in Washington, D.C.

mark landler And he also closes the Palestinian Authority’s representative office in Washington. The reason these moves are significant is because it has the effect of alienating the Palestinian power structure from the U.S. government and also undermining the credibility of the Palestinian leadership. Remember, any deal has to be negotiated between the Israelis and the Palestinian leadership. But by depriving the Palestinians of these resources, the Trump administration is, in essence, sending a signal that these people are not worth talking to. And that, in turn, has contributed to a rift that has opened up between the Palestinians and the United States over the moving of the embassy.

archived recording (donald trump) In a moment, I will sign a presidential proclamation recognizing Israel’s sovereign right over the Golan Heights.

mark landler Finally, and perhaps most importantly, President Trump recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights.

archived recording (donald trump) The state of Israel took control of the Golan Heights in 1967 to safeguard its security from external threats.

mark landler Like the West Bank and Gaza, the Golan Heights is a slice of territory that Israel seized during war and remains disputed until this day. In recognizing Israel’s claim over the Golan Heights, the Trump administration is, in a way, giving the Israelis a legal pretext to annex other territory that remains disputed.

archived recording (benjamin netanyahu) Look at this. It’s amazing. This is what I did in one week, by the way. I went to Washington and received this declaration by President Trump recognizing Israel’s sovereignty in the Golan Heights. Look at this. Look at what we just got.

mark landler It all amounts to a green light for Prime Minister Netanyahu to make a move on the West Bank. And indeed, a few days later, on the eve of the Israeli election, he did just that.

archived recording This was a big, last-minute promise from Benjamin Netanyahu in a close race. archived recording (benjamin netanyahu) [SPEAKING HEBREW] archived recording He says if he’s re-elected, he’ll annex parts of the West Bank seized by Israel half a century ago and home to nearly half a million settlers, a pledge —

mark landler He told the Israeli press that if he was elected, he would begin to annex large Jewish settlements on the West Bank.

michael barbaro Which is to say he would take as Israelis parts of the West Bank that would be part of this two-state solution.

mark landler That is exactly right.

archived recording So let me ask you this.

michael barbaro And what did the U.S. do?

archived recording Is it still the policy of the United States to oppose Israel’s unilateral annexation of any or all of the West Bank?

mark landler Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked what was the American response.

archived recording (mike pompeo) Here’s what I can say. I’ll give the same answer I gave the senator. We are in the process of laying down our vision for how to resolve a problem that is — archived recording So Mr. Secretary, if I could ask you, I asked about unilateral acts, right, annexation. So that —

mark landler And the U.S. response was conspicuous silence.

archived recording It sounds like you’ve already abandoned what has been a bipartisan foreign policy of opposing the annexation of any or part of the West Bank by Israel. Is that what you’re telling us today? archived recording (mike pompeo) I think we’ve seen — I think it was Senator Durbin that critiqued our decision on the Golan, where you would characterize that. archived recording I’m not asking you about the Golan. archived recording (mike pompeo) Yeah. archived recording I’m asking you about the West Bank. archived recording (mike pompeo) Yeah, and I’m telling you, you will see our proposal — archived recording The polls are closing —

michael barbaro It basically gives Netanyahu permission if he wants to annex these settlements in the West Bank.

mark landler There was no evidence that there would be any American pushback to that.

michael barbaro And is it safe to assume that if the United States and its president didn’t want Israel to take these steps and said, don’t take these steps, that Israel might not do them?

mark landler The answer to that is yes, and the proof of that is if you go back just one president to the Obama administration, you will find plenty of cases where Barack Obama pushed back on steps that the Netanyahu government was taking, particularly in the area of settlement construction, and actually pressured the prime minister to slow down or, in some cases, even halt that construction in order not to alienate their American friends.

michael barbaro And so given that, Mark, why is President Trump doing this? Why would he support Netanyahu in this way?

mark landler So part of it has to do with a genuine kinship between Trump and Netanyahu. They’re very similar figures, in some ways. They view the world the same way. There’s also some familial connections. Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, has a longstanding relationship with Netanyahu. Netanyahu once famously spent the night at the Kushner home in New Jersey. But there’s also a political motive for Donald Trump. Donald Trump knows that his base consists partly of conservative American Jews and evangelical voters. And for their own reasons, some having to do with Israel’s biblical history, some having to do with the desire for Israel’s security, these voters believe very strongly in Netanyahu’s agenda. So to the extent that President Trump emboldens Netanyahu, he’s also really playing to this important part of his own political base.

michael barbaro So Netanyahu was very skeptical of the two-state solution from the start. And now, after 40 years of the U.S. supporting that two-state solution, Israel’s greatest ally, the one whose permission and approval it constantly seeks, is on the same page. It is now skeptical of the two-state solution.

mark landler That’s right. Netanyahu, after years of butting heads with American presidents, finally found one who not only is on the same page, but is almost reinforcing his most aggressive instincts, and it grows out of a belief on the part of both men that a mighty Israel, that a strong Israel is not only in the interest of the Israeli people, but it’s also in the American interest, a stabilizing force, an anchor of democracy in the Middle East, a counterweight to Iran, the great enemy that Trump has identified in the Middle East. But the irony is that both of these leaders, in believing that they are securing Israel’s future, securing its long-term survival and stability, may actually be undermining it.

michael barbaro How so?

mark landler Well, if you believe, as many do, that the future of Israel lies in being both genuinely a Jewish state and genuinely a democratic state, the question is can you have both?

michael barbaro What do you mean?

mark landler If you don’t have a two-state solution, if you don’t give the Palestinians their own sovereign state, you face the prospect of what people call a Greater Israel. This is the one-state solution, where Israel simply annexes all the territory on the West Bank and Gaza and becomes one nation, with both Palestinian Arabs and Jews living inside of it. And you have essentially two alternatives for how that state would look. Under one scenario, you remain a Jewish state. You don’t give Palestinians the right to vote. You essentially have a disenfranchised part of your country stretching into the future. The other alternative is you give everybody the right to vote. And under that scenario, given demographic trends, with a much faster-growing Arab population, you face the prospect of, over time, losing the Jewish character of Israel. And so that’s why I say that you can either be a Jewish state or a democratic state, but under a one-state solution, it’s very hard to see how you can be both.

michael barbaro It seems from what you’re saying that democracy is what’s being sacrificed for the maintenance of a Jewish state.

mark landler Well, at the moment, the Palestinians who live on the West Bank are a disenfranchised people. They don’t have the same rights as Israelis who live in the state of Israel. So yes, there is already a degree of disenfranchisement that is necessary to maintain Israel as it exists today. The question is whether the Israelis are willing to institutionalize that arrangement permanently, to make it a permanent feature of a future state of Israel, rather than what we have now, which is, by all accounts, still a temporary situation, an Israeli occupation that everyone hoped would someday come to an end.

michael barbaro Mark, you said that it really didn’t matter who wins the Israeli election because of these changes that both Netanyahu and President Trump were able to accomplish during their overlapping tenures, but why is this really irreversible? Couldn’t a future U.S. president after Trump essentially take back those steps, reverse them once they get into office?

mark landler Well, I think the problem is that is much easier said than done. Several of the things that President Trump did are not going to be easily undone by anyone, either a new American president or a new Israeli prime minister. Take Israel’s control of the Golan Heights. Yes, it is true that there are already hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers living in the West Bank. But by giving the Israelis some legal credibility for settling and holding onto that area and exerting sovereignty over that area, you’re only going to invite even greater construction — new houses, new schools, new communities — that will make it even more unrealistic or far-fetched to think about a viable Palestinian state being built on that territory.

michael barbaro So essentially, the reality on the ground has been changed in such a way that cannot be changed back.

mark landler Yeah, I think that’s right. These two leaders have changed the facts on the ground in a way that won’t be easily undone no matter how fervent a supporter of the two-state solution follows Donald Trump in the White House or follows Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel. They have changed the equation. They have, in a sense, retired the old paradigm.

michael barbaro Mark, thank you very much.

mark landler Thank you, Michael.

michael barbaro On Wednesday, President Trump congratulated Benjamin Netanyahu on his apparent victory, saying it means there is now a better chance of reaching a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians.

archived recording (donald trump) But everybody said you can’t have peace in the Middle East with Israel and the Palestinians. I think we have a chance, and I think we have now a better chance with Bibi having won. Yes? Please. Thank you.

michael barbaro We’ll be right back.

[music]

michael barbaro Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (theresa may) Because the U.K. should have left the E.U. by now, and I greatly regret the fact that Parliament has not been able to pass a deal that would enable us to leave in a smooth and orderly way.

michael barbaro In its latest last-minute reprieve, the European Union has given Britain six more months to negotiate a Brexit deal after Prime Minister Theresa May once again failed to reach an agreement with Parliament before a deadline.

archived recording (theresa may) The purpose of this summit is to agree an extension which gives us more time to agree a deal to enable us to leave the E.U. in that smooth and orderly way.

michael barbaro The latest deadline for leaving the E.U. was April 12. On Wednesday, May had sought a new delay until June, but E.U. officials, skeptical that she could reach a deal by then, gave her until the end of October.

[space music]

michael barbaro And —

archived recording We are delighted to be able to report to you today that we have seen what we thought was unseeable.

michael barbaro On Wednesday, astronomers announced that they had captured an image of what began a century ago as a mathematical concept from Albert Einstein, a cosmic abyss so deep and dense that not even light could escape it.

archived recording We have seen and taken a picture of a black hole. Here it is.

michael barbaro The image of the black hole, which has a mass several billion times larger than the sun, was captured using data from telescopes in Hawaii, Mexico, the South Pole and Spain, among other places.

archived recording Radio waves from the black hole hit radio telescopes, where they’re recorded with the precision of atomic clocks that lose only 1 second every 10 million years.

You also may hear from me, Lindsey Underwood, editor of the newsletter. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.

Before January, I hadn’t had a Krispy Kreme doughnut or Chick-fil-A nuggets since I went gluten-free, at age 11. Those first few bites were absolute magic, but what surprised me most about going back on gluten was its effect on my social life.

What?

In sixth grade I had a host of unexplainable health issues that kept me from dancing, which was my world at the time. Desperate to get back into ballet class, I finally went off gluten and made some other dietary adjustments , at the recommendation of a naturopathic doctor. I was a bit skeptical, but when my symptoms disappeared almost overnight, I was sold on the diet.

I would get sick for a week whenever I ate gluten by accident, so I was never tempted to try it intentionally until earlier this year, when I was about to study abroad in Italy. I worried that in the land of pasta I wouldn’t have enough to eat, so before the trip I anxiously nibbled some bread. I didn’t get sick like I had in the past. That’s when my food freedom began.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/09/style/09editnewsletter-1/09editnewsletter-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/style/the-edit-diet-gluten.html,2019-04-09 00:00:00
Julian Assange Arrested in London as U.S. Unseals Hacking Conspiracy Indictment,"['Charlie Savage', 'Adam Goldman', 'Eileen Sullivan']","WASHINGTON — The WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was arrested on Thursday in London to face a charge in the United States of conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer network in 2010, bringing to an abrupt end a seven-year saga in which he had holed up in Ecuador’s embassy in Britain to avoid capture.

The Ecuadorean government suspended the citizenship it had granted Mr. Assange and evicted him on Thursday, clearing the way for his arrest. His hosts had displayed growing impatience, listing grievances including recent WikiLeaks releases they said interfered with other states’ internal affairs and personal discourtesies, like the failure of Mr. Assange to clean the bathroom and look after his cat.

A bedraggled and shackled Mr. Assange, 47, was dragged out of the embassy. At a court hearing, a judge swiftly found him guilty of jumping bail, and he was detained partly in connection with an American extradition warrant. Mr. Assange indicated that he would fight extradition, and legal experts said that process could take years. He is likely to argue that the case is politically motivated rather than driven by legitimate legal concerns.

Mr. Assange’s arrest brought to a head long-simmering tensions that have raised profound First Amendment press freedom issues. Since Mr. Assange began publishing archives of secret American military and diplomatic documents in 2010 — provided by the former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning — senior officials in two administrations had weighed whether to try to put him out of business by charging him with a crime.

Assange: A Self-Proclaimed Foe of Secrecy Who Inspires Both Admiration and Fury,"['Scott Shane', 'Steven Erlanger']","“Underground” hints at a kind of qualified idealism, suggesting that Mendax and his comrades mostly shunned theft and vandalism in favor of disclosure. The book describes “the early Australian underground’s golden rules of hacking: Don’t damage computer systems you break into (including crashing them); don’t change the information in those systems (except for altering logs to cover your tracks); and share information.”

By 2006, when he founded WikiLeaks, Mr. Assange had adopted a nomadic lifestyle, roaming the world and pronouncing sometimes cryptic principles about secrecy and information. By 2008, he was living in East Africa and exposing corruption in Kenya on the new site, which had published more than one million documents, including some from the Iraq war and the Guantánamo prison, as well as a potpourri covering less momentous topics: an early script for an Indiana Jones movie, Wesley Snipes’s tax bill and documents from the Church of Scientology and the Mormon Church.

But it was Chelsea Manning, then a low-level intelligence analyst stationed at a base in Iraq, who really put WikiLeaks, and hence Mr. Assange, on the map. Bored and harboring doubts about the war and American foreign policy, she began copying thousands of documents from a classified network onto CDs that she marked as Lady Gaga songs to avoid detection.

Back in the United States, she called both The New York Times and The Washington Post before connecting with WikiLeaks, where Mr. Assange and his fractious band of activist volunteers eagerly took up the cause in 2010.

They first posted a devastating video of two American helicopter gunships in Iraq shooting at suspected enemies on the ground — two of whom were among those killed and turned out to be war correspondents for Reuters. The news organization had struggled to learn the details of the strike; now the world saw not just the view from the helicopters, but it heard the pilots’ casual exchanges as they opened fire three times.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/us/politics/11dc-history1/11dc-history1-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/us/politics/julian-assange-chelsea-manning.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
"After Arrest of Julian Assange, the Russian Mysteries Remain","['Mark Mazzetti', 'Julian E. Barnes']","Numerous significant questions are left unanswered, including what, if anything, Mr. Assange knew about the identity of Guccifer 2.0, a mysterious hacker who American intelligence and law enforcement officials have identified as a front for Russian military intelligence operatives.

Court documents have revealed that it was Russian intelligence — using the Guccifer persona — that provided Mr. Assange thousands of emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of John D. Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign.

Another question is whether Mr. Assange was a conduit between the Russian hackers and the Trump campaign. Mr. Assange exchanged emails with Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Trump’s eldest son, during the campaign, and a Trump campaign official sent Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to the president, to get information about the hacked Democratic emails, according to a January indictment by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel.

Mr. Mueller concluded his investigation without an indictment that directly connected WikiLeaks, the Russians and the Trump campaign, suggesting that prosecutors did not find sufficient evidence that Mr. Assange knowingly engaged in a conspiracy with Russia to help the Trump campaign.

But the report drafted by Mr. Mueller’s team, and expected to be released next week, could have additional details about the ties between the Trump campaign and Mr. Assange. Those details could be redacted by the Justice Department, however, if officials believe the material includes classified intelligence, said Carrie Cordero, a former official with the Justice Department’s National Security Division and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/us/politics/11dc-mueller/11dc-mueller-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/us/politics/wikileaks-clinton-emails-russia-trump.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
"A Charred Gas Can, a Receipt and an Arrest in Fires of 3 Black Churches","['Alan Blinder', 'Richard Fausset', 'John Eligon']","Social media posts offered a glimpse of the man they arrested.

Facebook photos of Mr. Matthews show a young man with long hair. In one picture, he is wearing a black sleeveless T-shirt and holding a black electric guitar. He described himself as the lead singer of a black metal band called Vodka Vultures, though there was little online evidence of the band’s activity. Still, he wrote several posts that showed his familiarity with the genre.

He wrote favorably of the recent movie “Lords of Chaos,” a dramatized version of the black metal scene, and apparently referenced Varg Vikernes, perhaps the most notorious figure in the black metal movement, who was found guilty in Norway of killing a heavy metal guitarist and burning three churches.

The path to Mr. Matthews was laid out in an affidavit, with the big break coming Tuesday when an A.T.F. team found a piece of what appeared to be a two-gallon red gas can at Mount Pleasant Baptist Church.

The authorities realized that the same can was for sale at a local Walmart. On Wednesday, an investigator working for the retailer shared with them that a similar can had been purchased late on March 25 — less than three hours before the first church fire — along with a package of shop towels and a lighter, all paid for with a debit card that the authorities said was owned by Mr. Matthews.

Investigators learned, too, that Mr. Matthews’s father, Roy Matthews, was a longtime deputy in the St. Landry Parish sheriff’s office and the owner of a beige 2002 Ford pickup that appeared to match the truck that “consistently” appeared “around the time of each fire,” the affidavit states.

Sheriff Bobby Guidroz of St. Landry Parish said that he had summoned Mr. Matthews’s father on Wednesday to tell him that his son was considered a suspect in the fires, which all took place in the middle of the night and did not injure anyone.

“He was shocked and hurt, as any father would be,” Mr. Guidroz said of the older Mr. Matthews, whom he described as “a great deputy” and one of his best friends. “He was in terrible shape.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/us/11church-fires/11church-fires-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/us/holden-matthews-black-church-fires.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
White House Considered Releasing Migrants in ‘Sanctuary Cities’,"['Michael D. Shear', 'Zolan Kanno-Youngs']","WASHINGTON — President Trump’s top aides considered an idea to pressure immigration agencies to release apprehended migrants into so-called sanctuary cities represented by Democratic lawmakers, according to several people familiar with the proposal.

The idea was floated in an email by a top White House policy adviser in November, when Mr. Trump was furiously condemning migrant caravans from Central America headed toward the southwestern border, the people, including two government officials, said.

In the email dated Nov. 16, with the subject line “Sanctuary City Proposal,” May Davis, the deputy White House policy coordinator, raised the idea with officials from the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.

Ms. Davis suggested that migrants who had been apprehended and were slated to be released into border towns could instead be taken to one of several sanctuary cities, which limit how local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration officers.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/12/us/12dc-immig/11dc-immig-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/us/politics/white-house-migrants-sanctuary-cities.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
"The Fall of Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the ‘Spider’ at the Heart of Sudan’s Web",['Declan Walsh'],"But global notoriety was never much of a problem for Mr. al-Bashir, 75, at home in Sudan, a vast African country with a long history of war and suffering. He outwitted rivals who underestimated him, steered a decade-long oil boom that swelled Sudan’s middle classes, and forged a network of security forces and armed militias to fight his wars that some likened to a spider’s web with Mr. al-Bashir at its center.

That carefully constructed edifice of power crumbled this week as thousands of protesters massed outside his Khartoum residence, chanting slogans and braving gunfire as rival gangs of soldiers exchanged fire. The oil money was running low, the economy was in tatters and young Sudanese, in particular, had had enough. The spider had to go.

“Just fall, that is all!” they chanted.

On Thursday morning, the military ousted him, ending his 30-year rule in the face of the sweeping demonstrations. It said it had taken Mr. al-Bashir into custody, dissolved the government and suspended the Constitution.

Representatives of the principal protest group, the Sudanese Professionals Association, which had been expecting a statement from the military and were preparing to negotiate a transition to civilian rule, greeted the announcement with disappointment.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/world/11bashir1/11bashir1-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/world/africa/omar-bashir-sudan.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
Scott Kelly Spent a Year in Orbit. His Body Is Not Quite the Same.,['Carl Zimmer'],"Or maybe it’s that the immune system, which never evolved for survival in space, simply gets confused.

“Is it good or bad? We just know it’s more,” Dr. Mason, a co-author of the new study, said of the immune activity. “To know for sure, we’d need more astronauts.”

Mr. Kelly’s return to Earth on March 1, 2016, proved to be one of the biggest moments — biologically speaking — of the whole mission. His body showed signs of intense stress, and his immune system was in high gear.

"Falcon Heavy, SpaceX’s Giant Rocket, Launches Into Orbit, and Sticks Its Landings",['Kenneth Chang'],"Why is Falcon Heavy different from other SpaceX rockets?

The company’s workhorse is the Falcon 9 rocket, which first launched in 2010. The first stage of the Heavy essentially consists of three Falcon 9 first stages bound together. The second stages of the two rockets are identical.

The additional thrust allows the Heavy to propel 140,000 pounds to low-Earth orbit, nearly three times what the Falcon 9 can lift.

How does this Falcon Heavy differ from the first one?

On the test flight, the two side boosters were older versions reused from earlier flights. (SpaceX’s best innovation to date is landing the booster stage of its rockets and launching it again; traditionally, rockets have been one-use throwaways, with the booster stages dropped into the ocean.)

For this one, the side boosters had never before been used. They were the latest version of the rocket, called “Block Five.” (“Block” is what rocket companies call a major upgrade.) That boosts the thrust and how much the Falcon Heavy can carry.

Why did the second Falcon Heavy flight take so long?

Even though the first Falcon Heavy flight appeared to be nearly flawless, SpaceX probably made adjustments. That, after all, is the reason a rocket company performs a test flight for a new rocket design.

SpaceX also has had a backlog of Falcon 9 missions to fly. It launched 20 Falcon 9 missions in 2018, more than in any previous year, in addition to the one Falcon Heavy launch. The company was also busy at work developing its Crew Dragon capsule for taking NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station.

The market for the Falcon Heavy is also much smaller than once envisioned. When Mr. Musk first announced the rocket in 2011, he said he expected that there would be a 50/50 mix between the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy. In the years since, improvements have made the Falcon 9 more powerful, and miniaturization of electronics has shrunk the size of many satellites.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/science/11SPACEX3/11SPACEX3-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/science/falcon-heavy-launch-spacex.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
Lil Nas X’s Smash Makes Country Wonder if Rap Is Friend or Foe. Again.,['Jon Caramanica'],"The track also arrived at a fortuitous moment — on the heels of a trickle of Western aesthetics into the high-style universe over the last couple of years, and also following the success of stylistically diverse country performers like Kacey Musgraves, who have demonstrated that a country musician can be a beacon of cool far outside the genre’s walls. Even Kanye West recently took to the countryside, unveiling his last album at a Wyoming cowboy ranch.

In another moment, the aesthetic choices of “Old Town Road” might have been perceived as pure kitsch, but now they are kitsch with a side of tastemaker. And though the removal of the song from the country chart reflected an initial resentment, the mood soon switched. Some country singers said they found “Old Town Road” to be country, or country enough. They didn’t want to be on the wrong side of cool.

Billy Ray Cyrus, who joined the song’s remix, is not a country insider at the peak of his powers, but he’s still a performer with a great deal of resonance within Nashville thanks to his 1992 pop-country crossover smash “Achy Breaky Heart.” Cyrus’s “Old Town Road” verse is pure glitz, a blend of hip-hop braggadocio and country-boy-in-the-big-city awe: “Spent a lot of money on my brand-new guitar/Baby’s got a habit, diamond rings and Fendi sports bras/Ridin’ down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car.” The performance is effortless, showing a version of country music that’s cosmopolitan, flexible and self-aware.

Whether Cyrus’s co-sign will be enough for the industry side of Nashville to embrace “Old Town Road” remains to be seen. That’s because, when it comes to charts and common practices, country isn’t a genre or a set of sounds as much as it is an oligarchy, the product of a limited number of record labels; a media environment that relies heavily on radio (with programmers who can lack imagination, as female country performers have long known); and a profound bottleneck in terms of new talent and new ideas. (To be fair, country is not alone in this: In 2012, the K-pop novelty star Psy went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart with “Gangnam Style,” which was — and remains — one of the biggest viral YouTube songs in history, but was by no means a rap song in the American context.)

Nashville’s initial resistance suggests some unfortunate things about country as a genre: that it might not be able to make fun of itself; that it might look askance at outsiders, especially black performers; that it understands itself only through the lens of protecting its central ideology, and not as an omnivorous sound in dialogue with the rest of pop, and the rest of America. Country music is preoccupied with borders, and it treats each new incursion as an opportunity for identity crisis. It’s a wild contrast with contemporary hip-hop, which understands itself as music that borrows widely, and experiments with glee.

But perhaps the greatest indictment of how the country music leadership handled “Old Town Road” comes from a cursory listen to some other songs on the chart. Take “Look What God Gave Her,” the new single by Thomas Rhett, perhaps the ur-country gentleman of the last few years. It’s a soft soul song with a faint disco undertow, nothing country about it beyond the perceived affiliation of the performer. Elsewhere there are soft-rock ballads and R&B songs, none of them subject to anything like the skepticism that has greeted Lil Nas X, whose reference points might in fact be more classically country (even if refracted through a kitsch lens).",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/21/arts/21hiphop-country-promo/21hiphop-country-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-country-rap.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00

In the hands of the state such tools radically increase its power.

We’re looking to you to participate in this project. We’d like to publish your stories about how the sharing of your data hurt or helped you. When it comes to debating the right path forward, we hope to hear from technologists and policymakers, whistle-blowers and tech executives, advocates and academics, and anyone else who has an original and important solution or idea to contribute.

Opinion | Feeling Safe in the Surveillance State,['Jianan Qian'],"Last spring, I went back to China for a book tour that took me to six cities. Entering train stations felt like crossing border control at an international airport — my identity was confirmed not only by someone checking my documents, but also by one of the ubiquitous facial recognition cameras. One day, while a friend was driving me home after a reading in Shanghai, I saw one of them ahead of us on the highway. Well, we can no longer do “bad” things, he said, noticing my discomfort. It was supposed to be a joke, but we fell into a long, dead silence.

Many people in China seem to be happy about the physical security promised by the surveillance network. Our mind-set, long ago, was wired to see safety and freedom as an either-or choice. I remember a conversation I had during my first year in the United States, when I was visiting Chicago. A Chinese student told me he dared not walk alone in the city after 5 p.m. When I told him I’d recently taken a trip to a nearby 7-Eleven at 10 p.m. by myself to get a beer, he was shocked. “Why?” I asked him. “It’s a safe neighborhood.” Still pale, he said, “You only got lucky.”

The disappearance in June 2017 of Yingying Zhang, a young Chinese visiting scholar, from the Urbana-Champaign campus of the University of Illinois only reinforced this sense of danger everywhere outside China. Her kidnapping by a former graduate student made headlines across the country. The post that got the most shares in my WeChat feeds the week she disappeared was titled, “When you come to the States, leave behind feelings of homegrown safety. ”

The other reason that my people seem not to worry about the violation of their privacy is that they believe they are law-abiding citizens. “Only criminals need to be afraid,” they say. But I’ve heard other stories.

In 2018, Wang Qian, a young single mother from Zhejiang Province, hanged herself after she lost her savings on a peer-to-peer lending platform called PPMiao. In her suicide note, which briefly appeared on social media, she confessed her frustrations: Because she’d been a victim of a financial fraud — and therefore had grievances — she was now considered a threat to public safety and order.

She said that she, as well as hundreds of other victims who’d tried to stage protests over their treatment, had been beaten by the police. One month before her suicide, investors like her who’d lost their money had planned a rally in Beijing — but only a few managed to show up, because policemen and security guards had gathered on every street corner and at subway stations to check the identity cards of everyone who was nearing Beijing’s financial district. The protest, like most of the other protests in China, was never reported in domestic news outlets.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/14/opinion/sunday/14Qian/14Qian-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/opinion/china-internet-surveillance.html,2019-04-10 00:00:00

As you can probably see, online privacy is not an absolute must for many readers: There are some acceptable trade-offs depending on the information collected, who gets to see it, how it’s shared, and maybe most important, how it’s used.

Share of readers comfortable with each scenario Has already happened* Hasn't happened yet Your response internet Detailed information Activities from friends Uploads customer lists Buys information Tracks internet activity What you buy offline Basic data on friends Personal data on friends TV ads Physically in a store Not comfortable with any dna Determines genealogy Determines health risks Combines with survey data Research participant matching Sells analysis of data Conducts for-profit research Sells anonymous DNA profile Identifies relatives Identifies criminals Not comfortable with any smart doorbell Sends video/images Sends alerts Social network uploads AI identifies unknown people AI identifies faces faster Access clips with warrant Sexual offender matches Sexual offender alerts Police access to archives Real-time police access Not comfortable with any facial recognition Matches in workplace Unlocks door Spots shoplifters Determines age/gender Tracks eye movements Mugshot matches DMV matches Attribute detection Watches roads 24/7 Real-time crowd scanning Watches housing project Not comfortable with any * Some practices occur under specific or narrow circumstances, like with additional consent forms, opt-ins, or if you use specific services or technologies.

Note: Smart doorbell practices reflect those by major technology companies.

Surveys have found how many Americans are willing to make these kinds of trades, sacrificing a little privacy for a little benefit.

While it’s difficult to precisely rank privacy risks, we sorted our scenarios (some real, some that we can imagine happening soon) from most to least invasive based on conversations with experts. Judging whether a practice is “invasive” isn’t a science, of course. It’s more like a gut feeling, and it depends on how you feel about your own privacy, how much you value strangers’ privacy and the trust you have in corporations and law enforcement.

But the results also emphasize a quirk in our digital behavior: People rarely change what they do online, even when they express serious concerns about how their data is used. This is sometimes called the privacy paradox.

“One of the reasons people say one thing and do another is they don’t know what’s going on,” said Lee Rainie, the director of internet and technology research at the Pew Research Center. “It’s not that they’re being hypocritical, or that they’re mouthing one thing and immediately dismissing it in another moment. It’s that they don’t actually know.”

Researchers studying the paradox say internet companies make it hard for users to judge their privacy risks. Users might feel like they have no choice but to use services like email or social networks. The sites might also make it hard to learn about all of their data practices. Facebook, for example, has a lengthy Data Policy, but it’s written so broadly that it's nearly impossible to figure out what exactly they do with your data. Just signing up for a digital service often means consenting to all kinds of data use and collection.

Under those conditions, is it surprising people aren’t changing their behavior?

[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletter to explore what’s at stake and what you can do about it.]

Trusting Social Media

The paradox is clearest with social media, which has been a focus of privacy concerns for decades. Facebook, for example, has endured a barrage of bad press over the past few years, including the fallout from Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a political consulting company harvested information from millions of unsuspecting users to build detailed profiles on voters (a practice it ended in 2015). Even so, Facebook reported late last year that its number of daily active users in the United States and Canada remained steady at 185 million.

Until recently, Facebook did a version of many of the practices listed here.

Does Facebook do this, or has it? if you provide it collects personal information about me uses friends' posts to send me targeted advertisements lets companies upload customer lists so they can send me targeted advertising until April 2018 buys information about me from third parties on some sites receives details about my activity from other websites at some retailers receives information on what I buy in physical stores after granting permission lets third parties download basic information on my friends without their consent until April 2015 (after granting permission) lets third parties download information on my friends, like their relationship status and interests, without their consent it was tested in 2016 serves me targeted ads on a smart TV app that has a relationship with the website if you enable location services might know when I walk into into a physical store using the location I share with the phone app

So far, percent of our readers were comfortable with sites collecting personal data. But that doesn’t mean those basic practices come without risk. Agreeing to those basic kinds of data collection enrolls users in Facebook's entire data ecosystem.

Artificial intelligence “can make all of these things far worse,” added Joseph Turow, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the lead author on a 2018 study about modern surveillance. He said running machine learning — a branch of artificial intelligence — on basic information collected by social networks can allow them to “infer things that I couldn’t even imagine a company could learn.”

New Privacy Frontier: DNA

Is this already happening? uses my DNA to offer clues about my genealogy uses my DNA to determine specific health risks like cancer uses data from surveys I complete on the site to build a richer profile about me if you opt in invites me to participate in pharmaceutical research if my DNA profile matches research needs if you opt in sells an analysis of my anonymous/aggregated DNA profile to third parties if you opt in uses my DNA profile to conduct research on behalf of pharma companies if you opt in sells my anonymous DNA profile to third parties as part of paid research projects if you opt in lets customers identify relatives by matching DNA to other customers lets law enforcement agencies register as users, which lets them look for criminals by matching DNA profiles (without a warrant)

Genetic companies like 23andMe and Ancestry analyze customer DNA to provide clues about genealogy and health risks. But the data also offers another potential revenue stream: repackaging it as valuable data for pharmaceutical companies, colleges and researchers.

Both 23andMe and Ancestry allow customers to opt into research collaborations with third parties — relationships the companies say will lead to scientific breakthroughs.

Ancestry said it has no current for-profit ventures and only one nonprofit collaboration with the University of Utah. But in 2015, it partnered with the biotech research company Calico to analyze anonymized data from its trove of genetic samples and, possibly, commercialize their findings.

The deal ended last year, and its financial terms were never released.

23andMe said it’s currently partnering with pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline and recently collaborated with Genentech, a subsidiary of the Swiss pharma giant Roche. Past collaborations also include Grunenthal, Celmatix, Lundbeck and Milken Institute, and two with Pfizer.

The company said the vast majority of their partnerships use de-identified and aggregated data (so it’s pooled with other genetic profiles and summarized, removing identifying information). Other collaborations involved sharing parts of your DNA profile, stripped of additional identifying information like your name. 23andMe emphasized they provide several different opt-ins and consent forms before customers are enrolled. But privacy experts have questioned whether consenting to long documents full of legal terms is the best approach.

“The classic notice-and-consent regime that has been the anchor of all kinds of things — not just online transactions but who’s in medical trials and who is getting what kind of medical treatments – that regime is a complicated one,” said Mr. Rainie. “Especially when there are lots of little encounters, lots of little transactions, where a notice-and-consent format might be implicated, people are confused by all of this.”

In our poll, percent of readers were comfortable with pharmaceutical companies profiting from their genetic material.

Context and Combinations Matter

Is this already happening? in at least some schools uses facial recognition to match my face against a list of employees in my workplace planned for a Brooklyn building checks my face against a database of tenants in my apartment building tool is being marketed checks my face against a database of known shoplifters in a Walgreens pilot uses facial analysis to determine my age and gender in a Walgreens pilot tracks where I look in a store not in real time allows police to match my face against a mugshot database not in real time allows police to match my faces against a driver's license database an Israeli company claims to do this interprets the features on my face to guess other attributes about me in a pilot project monitors major roads or bridges 24/7 in the U.K. lets police departments scan crowds in real time in New York, according to a news report watches a subsidized housing project to identify people

All facial recognition practices listed here are happening somewhere in the world today, signalling how A.I. can be combined with video surveillance to create new privacy risks. New York City experimented with using facial recognition on drivers as they crossed bridges and tunnels around Manhattan. And an Israeli startup claims to be able to identify specific attributes like “high IQ” or “terrorist.” But in most cases, it’s hard to know exactly where and how the burgeoning technology is being used.

“For all of these, we know the capability is being advertised, but don't necessarily know if anyone is using the technology for that purpose,” said Clare Garvie, senior associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University Law Center.

While each piece of technology in our poll comes with some privacy risks, the most invasive applications can come when those technologies are used in tandem like this.

It’s possible to imagine how combining facial recognition with drones, or connecting it to a citywide network of real-time cameras, could suddenly make the technology far more invasive.

“It’s not the individual collections of online activity that’s the problem,” said Bruce Schneier, a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School and author of “Data and Goliath: The Hidden Battles to Collect Your Data and Control Your World.” “It’s the correlation of offline activity, and location, and income estimates, and so on. It’s not cameras on drones, it’s cameras on drones plus automatic face recognition, plus activity monitoring, plus predictive behavioral algorithms. It’s not any one individual privacy invasion – it’s all of them used together.”

Opinion | How The Times Thinks About Privacy,['A. G. Sulzberger'],"The Times, like many of these organizations, maintains clear internal guidelines about how such data is collected and used. But this control is often more limited than it seems because, in many cases, the news organizations that host the trackers don’t know what happens with that information once it is transferred to third parties. Those companies range from major platforms like Google and Facebook, to smaller companies you’ve never heard of that act as analytics providers and advertising intermediaries, to the individual companies that place individual advertisements. Readers may understandably wonder: What data do these companies have? To whom might they sell it? How might those buyers exploit it?

I ask myself those questions, too, as a publisher and as a person who uses the internet. As a journalist, I deeply believe that society benefits from the type of free-flowing information that overly broad privacy regulations could unintentionally impede. Our reporting often relies on leaks from whistle-blowers, personal communications of government officials obtained through records requests and computer-driven analysis of huge sets of data. But I’m also a person who values his own privacy — I have virtually no presence on social media — and I share the anxiety and mixed feelings that many have about the systematic collection, warehousing and sharing of personal data.

It’s clear that the rapid increase in data collection has resulted in many worthy contributions: creating a more interconnected world, saving users untold amounts of time and money, driving business and innovation and enabling important advances, from identifying public health threats to foiling terrorist attacks. But it’s also increasingly clear those benefits come with costs and trade-offs that society has not really reckoned with. People have little transparency into what is being gathered, where it’s being shared and how it’s being used — to follow their movements, to charge them more for health insurance or to manipulate them with political messages — and even less agency to do anything about it.

[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletter to explore what’s at stake and what you can do about it.]

Countless companies are wrestling with these trade-offs, many of them doing the best they can within a digital ecosystem they can’t hope to unilaterally reform. The internet doesn’t have to be this way. But change needs to be driven at a societal level — by politicians, leaders of major technology companies and the public at large.

While we’d welcome such change, we’re not waiting for it. The Times is committed to continue taking steps to increase transparency and protections. And our journalists will do their part to ensure that the public and policymakers are fully informed by covering these issues aggressively, fairly and accurately. Over the coming months, The Privacy Project will feature reporters investigating how digital privacy is being compromised, Op-Ed editors bringing in outside voices to help foster debate and contextualize trade-offs, and opinion writers calling for solutions. All of us at The Times will be reading closely as well, using their findings to help inform the continuing evolution of our own policies and practices.

Opinion | Our Disgrace at the Border,['David Brooks'],"On the one hand, these people are our neighbors. Many of them come to us with harrowing stories of husbands murdered, daughters raped, mass extortion. It’s our obligation and joy to reach out to them with a hand of solidarity. It’s barbarism to send them back to lawlessness.

On the other hand, many who are coming across seeking asylum do not qualify for it. When they get their hearings, only 20 percent win the right to stay in the United States because they’d face persecution in their home countries. Many come for traditional economic reasons. The murder rate in El Salvador has fallen in half since 2015, while the number of asylum seekers has skyrocketed.

The U.S. cannot take in everybody who wants to come. So the first task is to set priorities. The victims of violence and persecution get top priority, then those being systemically denied their basic rights because their country has become a failed state, then those seeking economic betterment.

Then you create a system to implement those priorities. Over the short term do the things any practical mayor would do: build new detention centers at the border; expand the capacities at the ports of entry; expand the number of judge teams, to speed through the backlog; create an orderly release procedure coordinated with humanitarian agencies; increase the number of counselors so refugees can navigate the system; vet children in their home countries for refugee status so they don’t have to make a fruitless trip.

Over the long term, you help build better police and justice systems in the home countries. You cooperate with Mexico to jointly tackle this challenge we face together. You might shift to a more skills-based immigration system while increasing the number of refugees we take in each year.

Designing a practical response that wins widespread support is, in theory, not hard. But it requires starting with a certain question: What can we do to help them? Much of today’s politics starts from a different question: What posture can I adopt that will reflect well on me? What can I say to prove I’m manly or woke?

This is what happens when the politics of practical action get replaced by the politics of performative narcissism.

Opinion | Is Assange’s Arrest a Threat to the Free Press?,['Michelle Goldberg'],"But the Justice Department’s desire to nail Assange for publishing information leaked by Manning never went away. Miller said that both former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wanted to take a new look at the case. It’s a relief that they found a way to make the case without a frontal assault on journalistic prerogatives. Still, if you read the indictment, a lot of things that journalists do routinely are part of Assange’s alleged crime.

“It was part of the conspiracy that Assange and Manning took measures to conceal Manning as the source of the disclosure of classified records to WikiLeaks,” says the indictment. Most if not all investigative journalists take such measures to protect their sources. The indictment says, “It was part of the conspiracy that Assange encouraged Manning to provide information and records from departments and agencies of the United States.” Journalists often do this when they urge whistle-blowers to come forward. “It was part of the conspiracy that Assange and Manning used a special folder on a cloud drop box of WikiLeaks” to transmit classified information, the indictment continues. Like many news organizations, The New York Times does something similar, soliciting tips through an encrypted submission system called SecureDrop.

For any of these actions to become part of a criminal conspiracy, there has to be a crime. But as Georgetown law professor David Super points out, “We have right now a criminal code that is bursting at the seams with offenses,” making it easy to break laws without realizing it.

A prosecutor, then, might be able to find a pretext for a similar conspiracy case if, for example, someone decides to leak the Mueller report, or Trump’s tax returns. “This pattern of behavior has already been turned against journalists in many parts of the world,” Super said. Journalists “get prosecuted for pretty mundane stuff, some of which they probably did, but they wouldn’t have been charged for if they didn’t make the regime unhappy.”

Assange seems to have thought that, by helping elect Trump, he would improve his own situation. As Julia Ioffe reported in The Atlantic, in 2016 WikiLeaks suggested to Donald Trump Jr. that Trump should lean on Australia to have Assange, an Australian citizen, appointed ambassador to the United States. Roger Stone, a Trump adviser who was indicted in part for lying about his communications with WikiLeaks, reportedly told an associate that he was trying to get Assange a pre-emptive presidential pardon. Now Assange has discovered, as so many others have before him, that betting on Trump can ruin your life. There’s a certain dark satisfaction in that. But any legal theory that Trump’s Justice Department uses against Assange can also be used against the rest of us.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/12/opinion/12goldbergWeb/12goldbergWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/opinion/julian-assange-wikileaks-first-amendment.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
"Opinion | Purity vs. Pragmatism, Environment vs. Health",['Paul Krugman'],"Right now there are two big progressive ideas out there: the Green New Deal on climate change and “Medicare for all” on health reform. Both would move U.S. policy significantly to the left. Each is sponsored by a self-proclaimed socialist: the Green New Deal by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Medicare for all by Bernie Sanders. (Of course, neither of them is a socialist in the traditional sense.) Both ideas horrify not just conservatives but also many self-proclaimed centrists.

Yet while they may seem similar if you think of everything as left versus right, they’re very different on another dimension, which you might call purity versus pragmatism. And that difference is why I believe progressives should enthusiastically embrace the G.N.D. while being much more cautious about M4A.

You see, for all its sweeping ambition, the Green New Deal is arguably an exercise in pragmatism — in the proposition that the perfect is the enemy of the good.

What’s the perfect in this case? Climate-policy purists are focused on the notion of a carbon tax to discourage greenhouse gas emissions, and they look down on any proposal that doesn’t put such a tax front and center.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/opinion/11krugman1/11krugman1-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/opinion/green-new-deal-medicare-for-all.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
Opinion | ‘Curious Eyes Never Run Dry’,['The Editorial Board'],"The arrest in London of the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange ends one bizarre saga, but opens a legal drama that is likely to stretch over many years and could probe uncharted areas of press freedoms and national security in the United States in the digital era. There is good reason to be watchful as the case unfolds.

Mr. Assange, a 47-year-old Australian, had spent almost seven years holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy, initially to avoid arrest on Swedish sex charges that have since been dropped , then British charges of skipping bail. But extradition to the United States was what Mr. Assange really feared, and what the cat-and-mouse game was always about.

It was in the United States that the materials posted on WikiLeaks created the greatest furor, first through the publication of a trove of classified documents supplied by an Army private, Chelsea Manning, and then by releasing material stolen from the computers of Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

The Obama administration was wary of pursuing Mr. Assange because WikiLeaks was essentially involved in investigative work common to a free press. But the Trump administration saw Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks as targets as soon as it took office. (Mr. Trump loved WikiLeaks in 2016 when it was embarrassing top officials of the Clinton campaign.) Two years ago , as director of the C.I.A., Mike Pompeo labeled WikiLeaks “a nonstate hostile intelligence service” after it released a cache of C.I.A. hacking tools. Efforts got underway then to build a case against Mr. Assange. This was confirmed through an inadvertent mention in a federal court filing last November.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/opinion/11Assange/11Assange-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/opinion/assange-wikileaks-arrest.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
Opinion | Thomas Edison Would Not Be Happy,"['C. Barry Edison Sloane', 'J. Heywood Edison Sloane']","The new standards, which would require these bulbs to be as efficient as widely used pear-shaped bulbs and would phase out inefficient incandescents and halogens, were approved in 2017 in the waning days of the Obama administration after a rule-making process of more than two years. Manufacturers and retailers have been preparing since then for the new rules to become effective on Jan. 1, 2020.

Unfortunately, the Trump administration plans to step back from that decision and exempt these bulbs from the standards. If that happens, American consumers will miss out on an estimated $12 billion in annual savings on their utility bills, or about $100 for each household, according to the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. It also means more electricity will need to be generated — 25 coal-burning 500-megawatt power plants’ worth, based on calculations by the Natural Resources Defense Council, creating the same amount of pollution that spews from the tailpipes of seven million cars a year.

The European Union has already banned incandescent and halogen bulbs, and many developing countries are in the process of doing the same, which means America could become a dumping ground for cheap, energy-wasting bulbs.

Congress and the public need to register their strong opposition with the Energy Department by May 3 to increase the odds that the agency will do the right thing and maintain these new energy-saving standards, not narrow their scope.

In addition to abandoning the standards on those incandescent and halogen bulbs, the Trump administration may opt to not enforce standards that require traditional pear-shaped bulbs and others to be at least 65 percent to 70 percent more efficient than old incandescents, beginning next year. The state of California imposed such a requirement last year, but an Energy Department lawyer testified at an administrative hearing in February that the department did not consider itself obligated to do so nationally, though a decision had not been made.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/opinion/11Sloane2/11Sloane2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/opinion/energy-efficiency-trump-light.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
Opinion | ‘What’s Your Favorite Book?’ Is Not a Trick Question,['Jennifer Weiner'],"One of my fondest memories of motherhood is of when my younger daughter, Phoebe, learned to read. It was bedtime, and her sister, her stepfather and I were settled in bed with our books. I kissed Phoebe good night and left the light on, and as I walked down the hall I heard her announce, “I am part of the reading family now!” (I felt good about my parenting, in a way I hadn’t since the incident, a few weeks previously, when, on our way to a doctor’s appointment, my other kid looked up at me with a sunny smile and announced, “Guess what I am not wearing today!”)

As an author and a lifelong reader, a girl who found refuge in books, I am glad that my children are part of the reading family. Many Americans are not. According to the Pew Foundation, almost a quarter of Americans said they had not read a book in the previous 12 months.

My guess is that school is to blame. Somewhere along the way, between “Beowulf” and Chaucer, people learned that reading was a slog and that literature consisted of books about characters who looked and sounded nothing like them, living in worlds that were nothing like their own. Reading was a duty and not a pleasure. And so, as soon as no one was forcing them to do it, they stopped.

The list of books that most schools still consider required reading — the canon, still heavy on dead, white, male authors — doesn’t help. Nor does the way some cultural gatekeepers, many of them proudly progressive and reflexively inclusive in other parts of their lives, seem invested in keeping the ranks of readers closed.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/opinion/11weiner/11weiner-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/opinion/favorite-books-romance-politics.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
An Artist Colony Thrives in the South African Desert,['Joseph Berger'],"There were works by local artists like J.P. Martin, who paints blurry, sepia-toned scenes of men and boys in athletic poses. Watershed also sells pillows whose covers feature more whimsical Schadeberg photographs like that of an African jazz trio wreathed in a nightclub’s cigarette smoke. We came away with a shapely ceramic vase whose design of pink flecks was created by Mr. Martin. It now sits in our living room.

Prince Albert is home to 30 painters, sculptors, designers and crafts makers, Mr. Steiner, Watershed’s owner, informed us. They are drawn by the village’s serenity and seclusion. Their paintings and sculptures are available down the main road at the Gallery, which also has a busy cafe.

From rock paintings to typewriters

When I asked Mr. Steiner when Prince Albert became an artist’s colony, his answer was gently admonishing of a Western perspective: “The first artists to make their mark,” he said, “were the Khoi-San who interpreted this arid ancient stretch of territory on the walls of caves and rock faces.”

Khoi-San is the catchall term for two groups of southern Africa’s indigenous blacks who are not speakers of Bantu languages, as the majority Zulu and Xhosa are. Known for the clicking sounds of their consonants, they had herded, foraged and hunted along the Swartberg slopes for thousands of years until they were gradually displaced by Bantu expansion some 1,500 years ago, and then pushed out by musket-wielding white settlers in the mid-18th century. The settlers derogatorily called them Hottentots (Khoi) and Bushmen (San). Their descendants today number about 400,000 and are scattered around southern Africa, principally in arid areas like the Kalahari.

The Fransie Pienaar Museum has photographs of rock paintings but is short on Khoi-San history. Rock paintings, which were done with ingredients like eland blood and egg white, depict elephants, eland and other animals as well as processions of hunters and other scenes of daily life. For those who have the time, there are a number of areas across South Africa where a visitor can see actual rock paintings, a prime location being the Cederberg mountain range two hours north of Cape Town. It has more than 500 painting sites, including a two-and-a-half mile rock-art trail and others accessible by hikers.

The rooms of the Pienaar museum chronicle the story of Prince Albert’s “founding” in 1762, a century after Dutch traders first came to this part of Africa, and are stuffed with 19th- and early-20th-century tools, dishware, telephones, typewriters, musical instruments, guns and other settler gadgets. After crossing the Karoo (a Khoisan word meaning desert) by wagon, the farmers Zacharias and Dina De Beer planted fruit orchards, vineyards and wheat fields. Other farmers followed and by 1855 the village could support a Dutch Reformed minister. A steepled church was built 10 years later, and it still dominates the village.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/14/travel/31princealbert1/31princealbert1-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/travel/prince-albert-south-africa-artist-colony.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
Magic Johnson Always Set His Sights Beyond Basketball,"['Marc Stein', 'Sopan Deb']","After last summer’s blockbuster signing of LeBron James, Johnson proclaimed the Lakers to be “back” — with the promise of a return to full “back back” status this summer once they acquired at least one superstar sidekick to James. Johnson has instead fled just when the most crucial work was about to commence, with no clear path to bringing that second star to a flailing franchise that last reached the playoffs in 2013 and last won a championship in 2010.

When he convened an impromptu news conference Tuesday night, rather than reveal his updated plan to restore the Lakers to title contention and placate a frustrated fan base, Johnson did just the opposite. Describing himself as “happier when I wasn’t the president,” he explained that the conditions and pressures attached to building a championship team around James meant that the real Magic “couldn’t come out.”

In a series of rambling interviews with a number of news outlets while the Lakers were in the process of losing their regular-season finale to the Portland Trail Blazers, Johnson spoke of how he had longed to send a congratulatory tweet to Oklahoma City’s Russell Westbrook or to tutor Ben Simmons, the rising Philadelphia 76ers star, without inciting a storm of tampering allegations.

“I knew if I stayed in the role,” he said, “I’m giving up a lot of me.”

Such disclosures, of course, only served to validate much of the skepticism that greeted Buss’s decision to install Johnson as the new face of the Lakers’ basketball operations in February 2017.

Rival front-office executives questioned Johnson’s lack of experience in the modern game and his willingness to embrace the all-encompassing nature of the job from the moment he was named to replace the much-maligned Jim Buss (Jeanie’s brother) and Mitch Kupchak, the longtime Lakers executive. Those questions only rose in volume when Buss named as Magic’s sidekick another front-office neophyte, Rob Pelinka, Kobe Bryant’s polarizing former agent.

There were red flags from the start. In taking on his first active role with an N.B.A. team since his second retirement as a player in 1996, Johnson admitted that he had much to learn about navigating the ins and outs of the N.B.A.’s complex salary cap and the rhythms of a job that had evolved so much in his time away.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/sports/11magic1/merlin_153299928_68145273-94c0-44bb-b1d0-1ec55f21a9a1-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/sports/magic-johnson-lakers.html,2019-04-11 00:00:00
I Thought I Could Serve as an Openly Gay Man in the Army. Then Came the Death Threats.,['Necko L. Fanning'],"The second week after I arrived at Fort Drum, N.Y. — my first and only duty station with the Army — I found death threats slipped under the door of my barracks room. I noticed the colors first. Pink, blue and yellow; strangely happy colors at odds with the words written on them. Some were simple: slurs and epithets written in thick black Sharpie, pressed so hard into the paper that it bled through. “Faggot” and “queer fag,” the notes read. A couple were more elaborate: detailed descriptions of what might happen to me if I was caught alone, and proclamations about the wrongness of gays in the military.

I read the most detailed descriptions over again, trying to explain them away as something other than what they were. Maybe they were a joke, or meant for someone else. I reached for my phone and then stopped. If I reported these and they were only a joke, then I would become “that guy.” Taking ridicule — smiling at the most vile and offensive slights with the understanding that they were nothing more than jokes — is the most important social capital in the military. Was I willing to risk losing that capital before I had the chance to earn it? I tore the bright sticky notes into confetti and tossed them into the trash.

The military is built on a foundation of earning trust and proving yourself to your peers and superiors as capable. Being new to a unit isn’t unlike being a new employee at any other job. People are cautious, even wary, until you’ve shown you can handle the work. Perhaps it didn’t help that I was an intelligence analyst in an infantryman’s world — a support soldier in a combat soldier’s unit. But none of that had been mentioned in the notes. My capability wasn’t in question, nor was my duty position. It wasn’t my effectiveness or value to the unit that elicited these noxious notes but something far removed from my control. Something that after September 2011 was supposed to be meaningless.

After a few months at Fort Drum, I discovered a group that convened for secret support meetings. No two people were similar — a woman who had been in the service nearly as long as I had been alive, a married father, an infantry soldier a rank below me. Each person identified as something other than heterosexual, but only privately. In their everyday lives, they pretended to be straight. We met in different places — in barracks rooms and offices after hours — but always in secret. Sometimes it was to console or commiserate. Other times I think it was to simply know that we weren’t alone.

During these meetings I always talked about my anxiety over not knowing who had written those sticky notes and if they were standing next to me in formation or would be the person I sat beside, alone, on my next 24-hour shift. The others revealed truths I considered much darker than my own: The woman spoke about the sexual assault she never reported during the time of “don’t ask, don’t tell” for fear that an investigation would unveil that she was a lesbian; the husband spoke about feeling trapped but fearing that revealing himself would cost him everything; and the infantryman confessed that he drank himself to sleep because he could never claim what he was aloud. At least I hadn’t had to endure any of their horrors, I would think. Remembering this was sometimes helpful — as if I were seeing things with greater perspective, finding the silver lining. Other times it made me nearly sick with shame to compare my fears with theirs. But I never stopped going.

I left the Army in December 2014, but I still feel as if I am coming to terms with my identity. There are moments when it feels wrong to claim my status as a veteran; as if being gay made me less of a soldier and somehow invalidated my service. These moments of vulnerability bring me back to when one of my superiors told me not to bring a date to the military ball; to when I found “Fag” spelled out in the snow on my windshield with urine; to all the times I avoided those who showed me compassion, for fear that it was a trick and that they had been the one to slip the notes beneath my door. Every memory evokes an emotion: rage that I had to serve with a constant sense of fear of my fellow soldiers; paralyzing sadness for those who endured abuses worse than I can know; and, the worst, guilt over the service members — gay or straight or transgender — who died while serving in the military while my body is still whole.

I don’t know if these feelings will ever go away. But it is when the guilt is most crippling that I remember my support group. That chance to share an unseen pain and know there were others like me struggling each day still helps me wake up each morning, pull on my boots and go about my day.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/10/magazine/10atwar-lgbt/10atwar-lgbt-facebookJumbo.jpg,[],https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/magazine/lgbt-military-army.html,2019-04-10 00:00:00
