 1. The date column as a string was formatted to "dd/mm/yyyy" so that it had a common nomenclature.

 2. In the "Location Description" column some are empty. As they are 4775 values out of 1048576 that are empty dropping them would not be great.In future when we slice and dice according to a year of data the empty value may reduce and then can be dropped. For example while slicing it from 2008-2012 range, there are only 17 rows and hence can be dropped.
 
 3. The latitudes and longitudes of about 63633 rows were missing hence to handle them we took the block address and used the google api geocoding service to get the latitude and the longitude. A script was written for the following.
 
 4.The Community Area is an important part of the dataset as it gives values community area wise.After getting the latitude and longitude of the rows which had missing values we applied two procedures:
 
 i.Used the communities areas shape file dataset given by Chicago government and generated a json for range of geopoints for each community. Later we tagged the unknown community area by passing the latitude and longitude.

 ii.Still there were few values giving none and not being detected any community. We further went ahead and generated a script which calculated the Euclidean Squared Distance Metric from each community area center and later the nearest community area was set to this row.

 5.Columns like District(47), ward(614840), X Coordinate(63633), Y Coordinate(63633),Location(63633) play least significance in the analytics part hence can be set as it is.

 6. Rest columns have 0 null values or empty values.

 To link crimes dataframe to sex offenders and get the scoring algorithm we needed to generate the community area name and community area number from the partial block address given.
 
 The following approaches were followed:
 
 i.Used the communities areas shape file dataset given by Chicago government and generated a json for range of geopoints for each community. Later we tagged the unknown community area by passing the latitude and longitude.

ii.Still there were few values giving none and not being detected any community. We further went ahead and generated a script which calculated the Euclidean Squared Distance Metric from each community area center and later the nearest community area was set to this row.

## 3. Community Areas (shape file) Dataset

https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Community-Areas-current-/cauq-8yn6

schema - Till Date

It provides the neighbourhoods names when given a longitude and latitude. It can return two values None or the corresponding communities names.

The shapefile provided on the Chicago Open Data Portal was used to convert it to a JSON file, with keys for each neighborhood, and corresponding values gave the latitude and longitude of the neighborhood.

## 4. Socio- Economic Factors()

https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2

schema - Till Date

This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” by Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012. The indicators are 

i) the percent of occupied housing units with more than one person per room (i.e., crowded housing)

ii)the percent of households living below the federal poverty level

iii) the percent of persons in the labor force over the age of 16 years that are unemployed

iv) the percent of persons over the age of 25 years without a high school diploma

v) the percent of the population under 18 or over 64 years of age (i.e., dependency); and per capita income

vi) Hardship Index
